An approach based on space density computations is used to choose an optimum indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. Typical evaluation results are shown, demonstating the usefulness of the model.","CACM","1975","8055","['Computer Science']","[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","['JournalArticle']","1975-11-01","{'name': 'Commun.
