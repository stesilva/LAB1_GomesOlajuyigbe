The rapid development of IoT devices and networks in various forms generate enormous amounts of data which in turn demand careful authentication and security. Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered one of the most promising methods for addressing cybersecurity threats and providing security. In this study, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) that categorize, map and survey the existing literature on AI methods used to detect cybersecurity attacks in the IoT environment. The scope of this SLR includes an in-depth investigation on most AI trending techniques in cybersecurity and state-of-art solutions. A systematic search was performed on various electronic databases (SCOPUS, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI). Out of the identified records, 80 studies published between 2016 and 2021 were selected, surveyed and carefully assessed. This review has explored deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques used in IoT security, and their effectiveness in detecting attacks. However, several studies have proposed smart intrusion detection systems (IDS) with intelligent architectural frameworks using AI to overcome the existing security and privacy challenges. It is found that support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) are among the most used methods, due to high accuracy detection another reason may be efficient memory. In addition, other methods also provide better performance such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), neural networks (NN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). This analysis also provides an insight into the AI roadmap to detect threats based on attack categories. Finally, we present recommendations for potential future investigations.","Electronics","2022","174","","['Review']","2022-01-10","{'name': 'Electronics'}","[{'authorId': '2149590607', 'name': 'Mujaheed Abdullahi'}, {'authorId': '9315276', 'name': 'Yahia Baashar'}, {'authorId': '2800915', 'name': 'H.

However, the increasing adoption of IoT devices has also raised significant concerns about cybersecurity and privacy. Blockchain, as a distributed and immutable ledger technology, has been proposed as a potential solution to enhance the security and privacy of IoT systems. Blockchain-based IoT systems offer several benefits, such as decentralization, transparency, and data integrity. However, they also pose unique cybersecurity challenges that need to be addressed for their secure and reliable deployment. In this paper, we review the existing literature and highlight the key challenges in cybersecurity for blockchain-based IoT systems. We categorize these challenges into three main areas: (i) IoT device security, (ii) blockchain security, and (iii) integration of IoT devices with blockchain (network security). Through an in-depth analysis, we present the current state of research and discuss potential solutions for each challenge. Additionally, we contribute by identifying future research directions to address these challenges and enhance the cybersecurity of blockchain-based IoT systems.","Applied Sciences","2023","33","","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2023-06-22","{'name': 'Applied Sciences'}","[{'authorId': '2180280043', 'name': 'Razan Alajlan'}, {'authorId': '2212611521', 'name': 'Norah Alhumam'}, {'authorId': '2210586703', 'name': 'Mounir Frikha'}]"

Without considering human behaviors, implementing these countermeasures will remain useless. Cybersecurity behavior has gained much attention in recent years. However, a systematic review that provides extensive insights into cybersecurity behavior through different technologies and services and covers various directions in large-scale research remains lacking. Therefore, this study retrieved and analyzed 2210 articles published on cybersecurity behavior. The retrieved articles were then thoroughly examined to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, in which 39 studies published between 2012 and 2021 were ultimately picked for further in-depth analysis. The main findings showed that the protection motivation theory (PMT) dominated the list of theories and models examining cybersecurity behavior. Cybersecurity behavior and intention behavior counted for the highest purpose for most studies, with fewer studies focusing on cybersecurity awareness and compliance behavior. Most examined studies were conducted in individualistic contexts with limited exposure to collectivistic societies. A total of 56% of the analyzed studies focused on the organizational level, indicating that the individual level is still in its infancy stage. To address the research gaps in cybersecurity behavior at the individual level, this review proposes a number of research agendas that can be considered in future research. This review is believed to improve our understanding by revealing the full potential of cybersecurity behavior and opening the door for further research opportunities.","Applied Sciences","2023","24","","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2023-05-05","{'name': 'Applied Sciences'}","[{'authorId': '2003363232', 'name': 'Afrah Almansoori'}, {'authorId': '1399262006', 'name': 'M.

As a contribution to scholarship on the ‘regulatory security state’, we analyze how the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), emerged and stabilized as the EU's key agency for cybersecurity. We use data from policy documents, secondary sources, and semi-structured interviews to show how ENISA struggled to become a relevant actor by carving out a specific role for itself. In particular, we show how challenging it was for the agency to acquire epistemic authority. Although the trajectory of ENISA supports attempts to govern through regulation, it also shows that its role was never a given, only functions as part of a larger whole, and continues to be subject to change. Our article indicates that the study of security governance must remain ontologically flexible to capture hybrid forms and political struggles.","Journal of European Public Policy","2023","27","","","2023-02-02","{'name': 'Journal of European Public Policy', 'pages': '1330 - 1352', 'volume': '30'}","[{'authorId': '147454724', 'name': 'Myriam Dunn Cavelty'}, {'authorId': '46954272', 'name': 'M.

Cybersecurity is well achieved by using appropriate sets of security governance frameworks. To this end, various Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity governance frameworks have been reviewed along with their benefits and limitations. The major limitations of the reviewed frameworks are; they are complex and have complicated structures to implement, they are expensive and require high skill IT and security professionals. Moreover, the frameworks require many requirement checklists for implementation and auditing purposes and a lot of time and resources. To fill the limitations mentioned above, a simple, dynamic, and adaptive cybersecurity governance framework is proposed that provides security related strategic direction, ensures that security risks are managed appropriately, and ensures that organizations’ resources are utilized optimally. The framework incorporated different components not considered in the existing frameworks, such as research and development, public-private collaboration framework, regional and international cooperation framework, incident management, business continuity, disaster recovery frameworks, and compliance with laws and regulations. Moreover, the proposed framework identifies and includes some of the existing frameworks’ missed and overlapped components, processes, and activities. It has nine components, five activities, four outcomes, and seven processes. Performance metrics, evaluation, and monitoring techniques are also proposed. Moreover, it follows a risk based approach to address the current and future technology and threat landscapes. The design science research method was used in this research study to solve the problem mentioned. Using the design science research method, the problem was identified. Based on the problem, research objectives were articulated; the objective of this research was solved by developing a security governance framework considering different factors which were not addressed in the current works. Finally, performance metrics were proposed to evaluate the implementation of the governance framework.","Journal of Cybersecurity and Privacy","2023","18","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2023-06-30","{'name': 'J.

AI has potential in strengthening the cyber capabilities and safety of nation-states, local governments, and non-state entities through e-Governance. Existing research provides a mixed association between AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity; however, this relationship is believed to be context-specific. AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity influence and are affected by various stakeholders possessing a variety of knowledge and expertise in respective areas. To fill this context specific gap, this study investigates the direct relationship between AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity. Furthermore, this study examines the mediating role of e-Governance between AI and cybersecurity and moderating effect of stakeholders involvement on the relationship between AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity. The results of PLS-SEM path modeling analysis revealed a partial mediating impact of e-Governance between AI and cybersecurity. Likewise, moderating influence of stakeholders involvement was discovered on the relationship between AI and e-Governance, as well as between e-Governance and cybersecurity. It implies that stakeholders involvement has vital significance in AI and e-Governance because all stakeholders have interest in vibrant, transparent, and secured cyberspace while using e-services. This study provides practical implications for governmental bodies of smart cities for strengthening their cybersecurity measures.","IEEE Access","2023","22","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","","{'name': 'IEEE Access', 'pages': '69783-69797', 'volume': '11'}","[{'authorId': '2159768691', 'name': 'S.

"1814944434626fa98d79e17b4732c2a5d5bb1151","","The Role of Machine Learning in Cybersecurity","Machine Learning (ML) represents a pivotal technology for current and future information systems, and many domains already leverage the capabilities of ML. However, deployment of ML in cybersecurity is still at an early stage, revealing a significant discrepancy between research and practice. Such a discrepancy has its root cause in the current state of the art, which does not allow us to identify the role of ML in cybersecurity. The full potential of ML will never be unleashed unless its pros and cons are understood by a broad audience. This article is the first attempt to provide a holistic understanding of the role of ML in the entire cybersecurity domain—to any potential reader with an interest in this topic. We highlight the advantages of ML with respect to human-driven detection methods, as well as the additional tasks that can be addressed by ML in cybersecurity. Moreover, we elucidate various intrinsic problems affecting real ML deployments in cybersecurity. Finally, we present how various stakeholders can contribute to future developments of ML in cybersecurity, which is essential for further progress in this field. Our contributions are complemented with two real case studies describing industrial applications of ML as defense against cyber-threats.","DTRAP","2022","113","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2022-06-20","{'name': 'Digital Threats: Research and Practice', 'pages': '1 - 38', 'volume': '4'}","[{'authorId': '119764154', 'name': 'Giovanni Apruzzese'}, {'authorId': '1754215', 'name': 'P.

Despite the AI benefits, its application suffers from the opacity of complex internal mechanisms and doesn’t satisfy by design the principles of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The lack of transparency further exacerbates the problem in the field of CyberSecurity because entrusting crucial decisions to a system that cannot explain itself presents obvious dangers. There are several methods in the literature capable of providing explainability of AI results. Anyway, the application of XAI in CyberSecurity can be a double-edged sword. It substantially improves the CyberSecurity practices but simultaneously leaves the system vulnerable to adversary attacks. Therefore, there is a need to analyze the state-of-the-art of XAI methods in CyberSecurity to provide a clear vision for future research. This study presents an in-depth examination of the application of XAI in CyberSecurity. It considers more than 300 papers to comprehensively analyze the main CyberSecurity application fields, like Intrusion Detection Systems, Malware detection, Phishing and Spam detection, BotNets detection, Fraud detection, Zero-Day vulnerabilities, Digital Forensics and Crypto-Jacking. Specifically, this study focuses on the explainability methods adopted or proposed in these fields, pointing out promising works and new challenges.","IEEE Access","2022","97","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","","{'name': 'IEEE Access', 'pages': '93575-93600', 'volume': '10'}","[{'authorId': '2067064455', 'name': 'N.

However, this is much easier written down than enforced. The executive order imposes new rules and requirements that will impact engineering practices and evidence collection for most projects and engineering teams in a relatively short period of time. Part of the response is the requirement to build up comprehensive inventories of software artifacts contributing to US government systems, which is a massive task when done manually would be tedious and fragile as software eco-systems change rapidly. Required is a system that will constantly monitor and update the inventory of software artifacts and contributors so that at any given point of time, the scope and involved teams for any software security incident can be notified and response plans activated. The front line of this security battle includes data mining platforms providing the security and compliance teams with engineering artifacts and insights into artifact dependencies and engineering practices of the corresponding engineering teams. The data provided does not only allow Microsoft to build an accurate engineering artifact inventory, but also enables Microsoft�s teams to initiate so called “get-clean” initiatives to start issue remediation before proper policy tools and pipelines (“stay-clean”) can be developed, tested, and deployed. In this talk we will present CloudMine1, one of Microsoft's main data mining platforms serving data sets and dependency graphs of more than 270 different engineering artifacts (e.g., builds, releases, commits, pull requests, etc.) gathered on an hourly basis. During the talk we will provide some insights into CloudMine, its engineering team and operational costs-which is significant. We will then highlight the benefits and opportunities a data mining framework like CloudMine provides the company including insights into how inventory and automation bots use CloudMine data to impact thousands of Microsoft engineers daily, saving the company significant costs and response times to security incidents: the ability to scan more than 100,000 code repositories across the enterprise within hours; building up an artifact engineering inventory enabling us to flag any known security vulnerability in any of the software components within hours; or spotting non-compliant build and release pipelines across Microsoft's 500,000 pipelines. In addition, we will also present open challenges the CloudMine engineering team is facing during operating and growing CloudMine as a platform, which will hopefully provide motivation and inspiration for researcher and other companies to start a dialog with us and other companies about these challenges and latest research results that may help us solve these issues. From the talk it should become clear that running enterprise scale systems is not cheap but worth the effort as it enables Microsoft and its engineering teams to respond to current cyber security threads even before we can build and test best in class built-in defense systems.","IEEE Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories","2022","104","['Computer Science']","['Book', 'JournalArticle', 'Conference']","2022-05-01","{'name': '2022 IEEE/ACM 19th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR)', 'pages': '639-639'}","[{'authorId': '39496137', 'name': 'Kim Herzig'}, {'authorId': '2172223304', 'name': 'Luke Ghostling'}, {'authorId': '2172223566', 'name': 'Maximilian Grothusmann'}, {'authorId': '39855161', 'name': 'Sascha Just'}, {'authorId': '2172228380', 'name': 'Nora Huang'}, {'authorId': '2172224059', 'name': 'Alan Klimowski'}, {'authorId': '2172209671', 'name': 'Yashasvini Ramkumar'}, {'authorId': '2172209669', 'name': 'Myles McLeroy'}, {'authorId': '1979660', 'name': 'Kivanç Muslu'}, {'authorId': '1906848', 'name': 'Hitesh Sajnani'}, {'authorId': '2172209406', 'name': 'Varsha Vadaga'}]"

Several machine learning and statistical methods, such as deep learning, support vector machines and Bayesian classification, among others, have proven effective in mitigating cyber-attacks. The detection of hidden trends and insights from network data and building of a corresponding data-driven machine learning model to prevent these attacks is vital to design intelligent security systems. In this survey, the focus is on the machine learning techniques that have been implemented on cybersecurity data to make these systems secure. Existing cybersecurity threats and how machine learning techniques have been used to mitigate these threats have been discussed. The shortcomings of these state-of-the-art models and how attack patterns have evolved over the past decade have also been presented. Our goal is to assess how effective these machine learning techniques are against the ever-increasing threat of malware that plagues our online community.","Journal of Cybersecurity and Privacy","2022","85","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2022-07-10","{'name': 'J.

In this article, we first examine AVs and different categories of the technological risks associated with them. We then explore strategies that can be adopted to address these risks, and explore emerging responses by governments for addressing AV risks. Our analyses reveal that, thus far, governments have in most instances avoided stringent measures in order to promote AV developments and the majority of responses are non-binding and focus on creating councils or working groups to better explore AV implications. The US has been active in introducing legislations to address issues related to privacy and cybersecurity. The UK and Germany, in particular, have enacted laws to address liability issues; other countries mostly acknowledge these issues, but have yet to implement specific strategies. To address privacy and cybersecurity risks strategies ranging from introduction or amendment of non-AV specific legislation to creating working groups have been adopted. Much less attention has been paid to issues such as environmental and employment risks, although a few governments have begun programmes to retrain workers who might be negatively affected.","Transport reviews","2018","419","['Business', 'Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2018-07-11","{'name': 'Transport Reviews', 'pages': '103 - 128', 'volume': '39'}","[{'authorId': '3299973', 'name': 'Araz Taeihagh'}, {'authorId': '41018764', 'name': 'H.

The goal in our exploratory curricular initiative is to dovetail the need to teach these two critical, emerging topics in highschool, and create a suite of novel activities, 'AI & Cybersecurity for Teens' (ACT) that introduces AI/ML in the context of cybersecurity and prepares high school teachers to integrate them in their cybersecurity curricula. Additionally, ACT activities are designed such that teachers (and students) build a deeper understanding of how ML works and how the machine actually ""learns"". Such understanding will aid more meaningful interrogation of critical issues such as AI ethics and bias. ACT introduces core ML topics contextualized in cybersecurity topics through a range of programming activities and pre-programmed games in NetsBlox, an easy-to-use block-based programming environment. We conducted 2 pilot workshops with 12 high school cybersecurity teachers focused on ACT activities. Teachers' feedback was positive and encouraging but also highlighted potential challenges in implementing ACT in the classroom.

Network communication has improved, helping the vehicles transition from completely machine- to software-controlled technologies. The autonomous vehicle network is controlled by the controller area network (CAN) bus protocol. Nevertheless, the autonomous vehicle network still has issues and weaknesses concerning cybersecurity due to the complexity of data and traffic behaviors that benefit the unauthorized intrusion to a CAN bus and several types of attacks. Therefore, developing systems to rapidly detect message attacks in CAN is one of the biggest challenges. This study presents a high-performance system with an artificial intelligence approach that protects the vehicle network from cyber threats. The system secures the autonomous vehicle from intrusions by using deep learning approaches. The proposed security system was verified by using a real automatic vehicle network dataset, including spoofing, flood, replaying attacks, and benign packets. Preprocessing was applied to convert the categorical data into numerical. This dataset was processed by using the convolution neural network (CNN) and a hybrid network combining CNN and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) models to identify attack messages. The results revealed that the model achieved high performance, as evaluated by the metrics of precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The proposed system achieved high accuracy (97.30%). Along with the empirical demonstration, the proposed system enhanced the detection and classification accuracy compared with the existing systems and was proven to have superior performance for real-time CAN bus security.","Italian National Conference on Sensors","2022","68","['Medicine', 'Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2022-01-01","{'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)', 'volume': '22'}","[{'authorId': '9092628', 'name': 'Theyazn H.

EVSE devices support the electrification of the transportation industry but also represent a linchpin for power systems and transportation infrastructures. Cybersecurity researchers have recently identified several vulnerabilities that exist in EVSE devices, communications to electric vehicles (EVs), and upstream services, such as EVSE vendor cloud services, third party systems, and grid operators. The potential impact of attacks on these systems stretches from localized, relatively minor effects to long-term national disruptions. Fortunately, there is a strong and expanding collection of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) cybersecurity best practices that may be applied to the EVSE environment to secure this equipment. In this paper, we survey publicly disclosed EVSE vulnerabilities, the impact of EV charger cyberattacks, and proposed security protections for EV charging technologies.","Energies","2022","65","","['Review']","2022-05-26","{'name': 'Energies'}","[{'authorId': '2115732116', 'name': 'Jay Johnson'}, {'authorId': '2006696237', 'name': 'Timothy Berg'}, {'authorId': '2142422067', 'name': 'Benjamin Anderson'}, {'authorId': '1576017824', 'name': 'Brian Wright'}]"

Loss of valuable data leads to negative consequences for both individuals and organizations. Cybersecurity is the process of protecting sensitive data from damage or theft. To successfully achieve the objectives of implementing cybersecurity at different levels, a range of procedures and standards should be followed. Cybersecurity standards determine the requirements that an organization should follow to achieve cybersecurity objectives and facilitate against cybercrimes. Cybersecurity standards demonstrate whether an information system can meet security requirements through a range of best practices and procedures. A range of standards has been established by various organizations to be employed in information systems of different sizes and types. However, it is challenging for businesses to adopt the standard that is the most appropriate based on their cybersecurity demands. Reviewing the experiences of other businesses in the industry helps organizations to adopt the most relevant cybersecurity standards and frameworks.

In this respect, the maritime sector, which until now was considered safe due to the lack of Internet connectivity and the isolated nature of ships in the sea, is showing a 900% increase in cybersecurity breaches on operational technology as it enters the digital era. Although some research is being conducted in this area, maritime cybersecurity has not been deeply investigated. Hence, this paper provides a close investigation of the landscape of cybersecurity in the maritime sector with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. First, it explores the systems available on ships that could be targeted by attackers, their possible vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit, the consequences if the system is accessed, and actual incidents. Then, it describes and analyses possible mitigation actions that can be utilised in advance to prevent such attacks. Finally, several challenges and open problems are discussed for future research.","Network","2022","56","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2022-03-07","{'name': 'Network', 'pages': '123-138', 'volume': '2'}","[{'authorId': '2158420447', 'name': 'F.

The three basic technologies for building the Metaverse are immersive technologies, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. Companies are subsequently making significant investments into creating an artificially intelligent Metaverse, with the consequence that cybersecurity has become more crucial. As cybercrime increases exponentially, it is evident that a comprehensive study of Metaverse security based on artificial intelligence is lacking. A growing number of distributed denial-of-service attacks and theft of user identification information makes it necessary to conduct comprehensive and inclusive research in this field in order to identify the Metaverse’s vulnerabilities and weaknesses. This article provides a summary of existing research on AI-based Metaverse cybersecurity and discusses relevant security challenges. Based on the results, the issue of user identification plays a very important role in the presented works, for which biometric methods are the most commonly used. While the use of biometric data is considered the safest method, due to their uniqueness, they are also susceptible to misuse. A cyber-situation management system based on artificial intelligence should be able to analyze data of any volume with the help of algorithms.

Bearing in mind that a considerable percentage of these infrastructures and service providers are under private sector control, the present article asks how this sovereignty discourse conceptualises the role of the private sector in EU cybersecurity. Drawing from a Regulatory Capitalism theoretical model, this article proposes that the EU has instead entered a Regulatory Mercantilist phase where it seeks to reassert its control over cyberspace, impose digital borders, accumulate data wealth and reduce its dependence on external private sector actors whose values may not reflect those of the EU order. A new approach to cybersecurity is emerging, in which the non-EU private sector can be perceived as much of a threat as foreign powers, and from whom digital sovereignty must be secured.","European Security","2022","46","","","2022-07-03","{'name': 'European Security', 'pages': '435 - 453', 'volume': '31'}","[{'authorId': '98881621', 'name': 'B.

Toward this goal, distributed energy resources (DER), including rooftop solar panels, battery storage, electric vehicles, etc., are becoming ubiquitous in power systems. Power utilities benefit from DERs as they minimize operational costs; at the same time, DERs grant users and aggregators control over the power they produce and consume. DERs are interconnected, interoperable, and support remotely controllable features; thus, their cybersecurity is of cardinal importance. DER communication dependencies and the diversity of DER architectures widen the threat surface and aggravate the cybersecurity posture of power systems. In this work, we focus on security oversights that reside in the cyber and physical layers of DERs and can jeopardize grid operations. The existing works have underlined the impact of cyberattacks targeting DER assets; however, they either focus on specific system components (e.g., communication protocols), do not consider the mission-critical objectives of DERs, or neglect the adversarial perspective (e.g., adversary/attack models) altogether. To address these omissions, we comprehensively analyze adversarial capabilities and objectives when manipulating DER assets, and then present how protocol and device-level vulnerabilities can materialize into cyberattacks impacting power system operations.

The persistence of these human performance issues is concerning given the lack of mitigation and integration of human factors practitioners to mitigate these adverse risk circumstances. Security fatigue is not a new phenomenon but the evolving nature of cybersecurity results in various sub-categories of security fatigue; thus, making it a difficult problem to solve. Stress and burnout are major causes of short tenures in senior roles for security executives. Business decision-makers lack the expertise to explore the negative influences of stress, burnout, and security fatigue on cybersecurity. Technology-led cycles are organizations’ primary course of action to mitigate cybersecurity threats, resulting in complexity debt and making businesses more vulnerable to attacks. Human factors professionals can identify high-friction areas that degrade human performance and implement initiatives to reduce the risk. Human performance degradation in cybersecurity is a critical risk factor and requires immediate attention, given that cybercriminals continue to exploit human weaknesses to gain access to sensitive and critical infrastructure.","Holistica","2022","36","","","2022-06-28","{'name': 'HOLISTICA – Journal of Business and Public Administration', 'pages': '49 - 72', 'volume': '13'}","[{'authorId': '152376142', 'name': 'C.

However, by their very nature, machine learning systems can introduce vulnerabilities to a security defence whereby a learnt model is unaware of so-called adversarial examples that may intentionally result in mis-classification and therefore bypass a system. Adversarial machine learning has been a research topic for over a decade and is now an accepted but open problem. Much of the early research on adversarial examples has addressed issues related to computer vision, yet as machine learning continues to be adopted in other domains, then likewise it is important to assess the potential vulnerabilities that may occur. A key part of transferring to new domains relates to functionality-preservation, such that any crafted attack can still execute the original intended functionality when inspected by a human and/or a machine. In this literature survey, our main objective is to address the domain of adversarial machine learning attacks and examine the robustness of machine learning models in the cybersecurity and intrusion detection domains. We identify the key trends in current work observed in the literature, and explore how these relate to the research challenges that remain open for future works. Inclusion criteria were: articles related to functionality-preservation in adversarial machine learning for cybersecurity or intrusion detection with insight into robust classification. Generally, we excluded works that are not yet peer-reviewed; however, we included some significant papers that make a clear contribution to the domain. There is a risk of subjective bias in the selection of non-peer reviewed articles; however, this was mitigated by co-author review. We selected the following databases with a sizeable computer science element to search and retrieve literature: IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, Scopus, SpringerLink, and Google Scholar. The literature search was conducted up to January 2022. We have striven to ensure a comprehensive coverage of the domain to the best of our knowledge. We have performed systematic searches of the literature, noting our search terms and results, and following up on all materials that appear relevant and fit within the topic domains of this review.

To safeguard an organization’s cyberenvironments, information, and communication technologies, many enterprises are investing substantially in cybersecurity these days. One part of the cyberdefense mechanism is building an enterprises’ security policies library, for consistent implementation of security controls. Significant and common cybersecurity policies of various enterprises are compared and explored in this study to provide robust and comprehensive cybersecurity knowledge that can be used in various enterprises. Several significant common security policies were identified and discussed in this comprehensive study. This study identified 10 common cybersecurity policy aspects in five enterprises: healthcare, finance, education, aviation, and e-commerce. We aimed to build a strong infrastructure in each business, and investigate the security laws and policies that apply to all businesses in each sector. Furthermore, the findings of this study reveal that the importance of cybersecurity requirements differ across multiple organizations. The choice and applicability of cybersecurity policies are determined by the type of information under control and the security requirements of organizations in relation to these policies.","Italian National Conference on Sensors","2022","36","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['JournalArticle']","2022-01-01","{'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)', 'volume': '22'}","[{'authorId': '144204979', 'name': 'A.

However, it focuses more on theories and models but fails to provide learners with practical problem-solving skills and opportunities to explore real-world cybersecurity challenges. Problem-based Learning (PBL) has been identified as an efficient pedagogy for many disciplines, especially engineering education. It provides learners with real-world complex problem scenarios, which encourages learners to collaborate with classmates, ask questions and develop a deeper understanding of the concepts while solving real-world cybersecurity problems. This paper describes the application of the PBL methodology to enhance professional training-based cybersecurity education. The authors developed an online laboratory environment to apply PBL with Knowledge-Graph (KG) based guidance for hands-on labs in cybersecurity training.Learners are provided access to a virtual lab environment with knowledge graph guidance to simulated real-life cybersecurity scenarios. Thus, they are forced to think independently and apply their knowledge to create cyber-attacks and defend approaches to solve problems provided to them in each lab. Our experimental study shows that learners tend to gain more enhanced learning outcomes by leveraging PBL with knowledge graph guidance, become more aware of cybersecurity and relevant concepts, and also express interest in keep learning of cybersecurity using our system.","Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Technology","2022","30","","","2022-02-13","{'name': 'Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Technology'}","[{'authorId': '2310475', 'name': 'Yuli Deng'}, {'authorId': '48000683', 'name': 'Zhengping Zeng'}, {'authorId': '2154394108', 'name': 'Kritshekhar Jha'}, {'authorId': '34577327', 'name': 'Dijiang Huang'}]"
