This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are defined and described in terms of their key characteristics and capabilities. Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A research and education are identified. We also report a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications, researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade of related academic and industry publications. Finally, the six articles that comprise this special issue are introduced and characterized in terms of the proposed BI&A research framework.","MIS Q.","2012","5375","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['JournalArticle']","2012-12-01","{'name': 'MIS Q.', 'pages': '1165-1188', 'volume': '36'}","[{'authorId': '47666658', 'name': 'Hsinchun Chen'}, {'authorId': '145802082', 'name': 'R.

Executives can measure and therefore manage more precisely than ever before. They can make better predictions and smarter decisions. They can target more-effective interventions in areas that so far have been dominated by gut and intuition rather than by data and rigor. The differences between big data and analytics are a matter of volume, velocity, and variety: More data now cross the internet every second than were stored in the entire internet 20 years ago. Nearly real-time information makes it possible for a company to be much more agile than its competitors. And that information can come from social networks, images, sensors, the web, or other unstructured sources. The managerial challenges, however, are very real. Senior decision makers have to learn to ask the right questions and embrace evidence-based decision making. Organizations must hire scientists who can find patterns in very large data sets and translate them into useful business information. IT departments have to work hard to integrate all the relevant internal and external sources of data. The authors offer two success stories to illustrate how companies are using big data: PASSUR Aerospace enables airlines to match their actual and estimated arrival times. Sears Holdings directly analyzes its incoming store data to make promotions much more precise and faster.","Harvard Business Review","2012","4271","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['JournalArticle']","2012-10-01","{'name': 'Harvard business review', 'pages': '\n          60-6, 68, 128\n        ', 'volume': '90 10'}","[{'authorId': '3132693', 'name': 'Andrew P.

Many have come to believe that because of this, transformers are not suitable for small sets of data. This trend leads to concerns such as: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the exclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this paper, we aim to present an approach for small-scale learning by introducing Compact Transformers. We show for the first time that with the right size, convolutional tokenization, transformers can avoid overfitting and outperform state-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets. Our models are flexible in terms of model size, and can have as little as 0.28M parameters while achieving competitive results. Our best model can reach 98% accuracy when training from scratch on CIFAR-10 with only 3.7M parameters, which is a significant improvement in data-efficiency over previous Transformer based models being over 10x smaller than other transformers and is 15% the size of ResNet50 while achieving similar performance. CCT also outperforms many modern CNN based approaches, and even some recent NAS-based approaches. Additionally, we obtain a new SOTA result on Flowers-102 with 99.76% top-1 accuracy, and improve upon the existing baseline on ImageNet (82.71% accuracy with 29% as many parameters as ViT), as well as NLP tasks. Our simple and compact design for transformers makes them more feasible to study for those with limited computing resources and/or dealing with small datasets, while extending existing research efforts in data efficient transformers. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Compact-Transformers.","arXiv.org","2021","435","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2021-04-12","{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume': 'abs/2104.05704'}","[{'authorId': '2855934', 'name': 'Ali Hassani'}, {'authorId': '102471415', 'name': 'Steven Walton'}, {'authorId': '2087066452', 'name': 'Nikhil Shah'}, {'authorId': '133551208', 'name': 'Abulikemu Abuduweili'}, {'authorId': '2125031571', 'name': 'Jiachen Li'}, {'authorId': '48667025', 'name': 'Humphrey Shi'}]"

A persistent source of ""big data,"" or data that is enormous in volume, diverse in type, and has a complicated multidimensional structure, is internet applications and communications. Today, several measures are routinely performed with no assurance that any of them will be helpful in understanding the phenomenon of interest in an era of automatic, large-scale data collection. Online transactions that involve buying, selling, or even investing are all examples of e-commerce. As a result, they generate data that has a complex structure and a high dimension. The usual data storage techniques cannot handle those enormous volumes of data. There is a lot of work being done to find ways to minimize the dimensionality of big data in order to provide analytics reports that are even more accurate and data visualizations that are more interesting. As a result, the purpose of this survey study is to give an overview of big data analytics along with related problems and issues that go beyond technology.","Iraqi Journal for Computers and Informatics","2022","403","","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2022-06-11","{'name': 'Iraqi Journal for Computers and Informatics'}","[{'authorId': '2269971203', 'name': 'Wasnaa Kadhim Jawad'}, {'authorId': '2261850659', 'name': 'Abbas M.

"4e6bba65f7636a655c778a3e54cc58e148468963","","CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR BIG DATA","The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric.","","2012","3532","['Sociology']","","2012-05-25","{'name': 'Information, Communication & Society', 'pages': '662 - 679', 'volume': '15'}","[{'authorId': '38818867', 'name': 'D.

Analysis of these massive data requires a lot of efforts at multiple levels to extract knowledge for decision making. Therefore, big data analysis is a current area of research and development. The basic objective of this paper is to explore the potential impact of big data challenges, open research issues, and various tools associated with it. As a result, this article provides a platform to explore big data at numerous stages. Additionally, it opens a new horizon for researchers to develop the solution, based on the challenges and open research issues.","International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology","2022","163","['Computer Science']","['Review']","2022-12-31","{'name': 'International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology'}","[{'authorId': '2150744', 'name': 'D.

"1d174f0e3c391368d0f3384a144a6c7487f2a143","","Big Data's Disparate Impact","Advocates of algorithmic techniques like data mining argue that these techniques eliminate human biases from the decision-making process. But an algorithm is only as good as the data it works with. Data is frequently imperfect in ways that allow these algorithms to inherit the prejudices of prior decision makers. In other cases, data may simply reflect the widespread biases that persist in society at large. In still others, data mining can discover surprisingly useful regularities that are really just preexisting patterns of exclusion and inequality. Unthinking reliance on data mining can deny historically disadvantaged and vulnerable groups full participation in society. Worse still, because the resulting discrimination is almost always an unintentional emergent property of the algorithm’s use rather than a conscious choice by its programmers, it can be unusually hard to identify the source of the problem or to explain it to a court.This Essay examines these concerns through the lens of American antidiscrimination law — more particularly, through Title VII’s prohibition of discrimination in employment. In the absence of a demonstrable intent to discriminate, the best doctrinal hope for data mining’s victims would seem to lie in disparate impact doctrine. Case law and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Uniform Guidelines, though, hold that a practice can be justified as a business necessity when its outcomes are predictive of future employment outcomes, and data mining is specifically designed to find such statistical correlations. Unless there is a reasonably practical way to demonstrate that these discoveries are spurious, Title VII would appear to bless its use, even though the correlations it discovers will often reflect historic patterns of prejudice, others’ discrimination against members of protected groups, or flaws in the underlying dataAddressing the sources of this unintentional discrimination and remedying the corresponding deficiencies in the law will be difficult technically, difficult legally, and difficult politically. There are a number of practical limits to what can be accomplished computationally. For example, when discrimination occurs because the data being mined is itself a result of past intentional discrimination, there is frequently no obvious method to adjust historical data to rid it of this taint. Corrective measures that alter the results of the data mining after it is complete would tread on legally and politically disputed terrain. These challenges for reform throw into stark relief the tension between the two major theories underlying antidiscrimination law: anticlassification and antisubordination. Finding a solution to big data’s disparate impact will require more than best efforts to stamp out prejudice and bias; it will require a wholesale reexamination of the meanings of “discrimination” and “fairness.”","","2016","2405","['Sociology']","","","{'name': 'California Law Review', 'pages': '671', 'volume': '104'}","[{'authorId': '2881033', 'name': 'Solon Barocas'}, {'authorId': '46432110', 'name': 'Andrew D.

However, the privacy and security of big data has become an emerging issue that restricts the organization to utilize Cloud services. The existing privacy preserving approaches showed several drawbacks such as a lack of data privacy and accurate data analysis, a lack of efficiency of performance, and completely rely on third party. In order to overcome such an issue, the Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) methodology is proposed to provide security for big data in the Cloud environment. The proposed TDES methodology provides a relatively simpler technique by increasing the sizes of keys in Data Encryption Standard (DES) to protect against attacks and defend the privacy of data. The experimental results showed that the proposed TDES method is effective in providing security and privacy to big healthcare data in the Cloud environment. The proposed TDES methodology showed less encryption and decryption time compared to the existing Intelligent Framework for Healthcare Data Security (IFHDS) method.","Big Data and Cognitive Computing","2022","61","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2022-09-26","{'name': 'Big Data Cogn.

"94deb62af3054c49e7d80bd7eb3ed5efe990fc0b","","Traffic Flow Prediction With Big Data: A Deep Learning Approach","Accurate and timely traffic flow information is important for the successful deployment of intelligent transportation systems. Over the last few years, traffic data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Existing traffic flow prediction methods mainly use shallow traffic prediction models and are still unsatisfying for many real-world applications. This situation inspires us to rethink the traffic flow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big traffic data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for traffic flow prediction has superior performance.","IEEE transactions on intelligent transportation systems (Print)","2015","2618","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['JournalArticle']","2015-04-01","{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems', 'pages': '865-873', 'volume': '16'}","[{'authorId': '34859953', 'name': 'Yisheng Lv'}, {'authorId': '2241838', 'name': 'Y.

Recent breakthrough results in image analysis and speech recognition have generated a massive interest in this field because also applications in many other domains providing big data seem possible. On a downside, the mathematical and computational methodology underlying deep learning models is very challenging, especially for interdisciplinary scientists. For this reason, we present in this paper an introductory review of deep learning approaches including Deep Feedforward Neural Networks (D-FFNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Autoencoders (AEs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models form the major core architectures of deep learning models currently used and should belong in any data scientist's toolbox. Importantly, those core architectural building blocks can be composed flexibly—in an almost Lego-like manner—to build new application-specific network architectures. Hence, a basic understanding of these network architectures is important to be prepared for future developments in AI.","Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence","2020","410","['Medicine', 'Computer Science']","['Review', 'JournalArticle']","2020-02-28","{'name': 'Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence', 'volume': '3'}","[{'authorId': '1399003993', 'name': 'F.

Machine learning algorithms are used to uncover patterns among the attributes of this data. Hence, they can be used to make predictions that can be used by medical practitioners and people at managerial level to make executive decisions. Not all the attributes in the datasets generated are important for training the machine learning algorithms. Some attributes might be irrelevant and some might not affect the outcome of the prediction. Ignoring or removing these irrelevant or less important attributes reduces the burden on machine learning algorithms. In this work two of the prominent dimensionality reduction techniques, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are investigated on four popular Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Decision Tree Induction, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes Classifier and Random Forest Classifier using publicly available Cardiotocography (CTG) dataset from University of California and Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The experimentation results prove that PCA outperforms LDA in all the measures. Also, the performance of the classifiers, Decision Tree, Random Forest examined is not affected much by using PCA and LDA.To further analyze the performance of PCA and LDA the eperimentation is carried out on Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) datasets. Experimentation results prove that ML algorithms with PCA produce better results when dimensionality of the datasets is high. When dimensionality of datasets is low it is observed that the ML algorithms without dimensionality reduction yields better results.","IEEE Access","2020","521","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2020-03-16","{'name': 'IEEE Access', 'pages': '54776-54788', 'volume': '8'}","[{'authorId': '38608914', 'name': 'G.

Indeed, Google has recently begun to replace much of its existing non–machine learning technology with machine learning algorithms, and there is great optimism that these techniques can provide similar improvements across many sectors. It isnosurprisethenthatmedicineisawashwithclaims of revolution from the application of machine learning to big health care data. Recent examples have demonstrated that big data and machine learning can create algorithms that perform on par with human physicians.1 Though machine learning and big data may seem mysterious at first, they are in fact deeply related to traditional statistical models that are recognizable to most clinicians. It is our hope that elucidating these connections will demystify these techniques and provide a set of reasonable expectations for the role of machine learning and big data in health care. Machine learning was originally described as a program that learns to perform a task or make a decision automatically from data, rather than having the behavior explicitlyprogrammed.However,thisdefinitionisverybroad and could cover nearly any form of data-driven approach. For instance, consider the Framingham cardiovascular risk score,whichassignspointstovariousfactorsandproduces a number that predicts 10-year cardiovascular risk. Should this be considered an example of machine learning? The answer might obviously seem to be no. Closer inspection oftheFraminghamriskscorerevealsthattheanswermight not be as obvious as it first seems. The score was originally created2 by fitting a proportional hazards model to data frommorethan5300patients,andsothe“rule”wasinfact learnedentirelyfromdata.Designatingariskscoreasamachine learning algorithm might seem a strange notion, but this example reveals the uncertain nature of the original definition of machine learning. It is perhaps more useful to imagine an algorithm as existing along a continuum between fully human-guided vs fully machine-guided data analysis. To understand the degree to which a predictive or diagnostic algorithm can said to be an instance of machine learning requires understanding how much of its structure or parameters were predetermined by humans. The trade-off between human specificationofapredictivealgorithm’spropertiesvslearning those properties from data is what is known as the machine learning spectrum. Returning to the Framingham study, to create the original risk score statisticians and clinical experts worked together to make many important decisions, such as which variables to include in the model, therelationshipbetweenthedependentandindependent variables, and variable transformations and interactions. Since considerable human effort was used to define these properties, it would place low on the machine learning spectrum (#19 in the Figure and Supplement). Many evidence-based clinical practices are based on a statistical model of this sort, and so many clinical decisions in fact exist on the machine learning spectrum (middle left of Figure). On the extreme low end of the machine learning spectrum would be heuristics and rules of thumb that do not directly involve the use of any rules or models explicitly derived from data (bottom left of Figure). Suppose a new cardiovascular risk score is created that includes possible extensions to the original model. For example, it could be that risk factors should not be added but instead should be multiplied or divided, or perhaps a particularly important risk factor should square the entire score if it is present. Moreover, if it is not known in advance which variables will be important, but thousands of individual measurements have been collected, how should a good model be identified from among the infinite possibilities? This is precisely what a machine learning algorithm attempts to do. As humans impose fewer assumptions on the algorithm, it moves further up the machine learning spectrum. However, there is never a specific threshold wherein a model suddenly becomes “machine learning”; rather, all of these approaches exist along a continuum, determined by how many human assumptions are placed onto the algorithm. An example of an approach high on the machine learning spectrum has recently emerged in the form of so-called deep learning models. Deep learning models are stunningly complex networks of artificial neurons that were designed expressly to create accurate models directly from raw data. Researchers recently demonstrated a deep learning algorithm capable of detecting diabetic retinopathy (#4 in the Figure, top center) from retinal photographs at a sensitivity equal to or greater than that of ophthalmologists.1 This model learned the diagnosis procedure directly from the raw pixels of the images with no human intervention outside of a team of ophthalmologists who annotated each image with the correct diagnosis. Because they are able to learn the task with little human instruction or prior assumptions, these deep learning algorithms rank very high on the machine learning spectrum (Figure, light blue circles). Though they require less human guidance, deep learning algorithms for image recognition require enormous amounts of data to capture the full complexity, variety, and nuance inherent to real-world images. Consequently, these algorithms often require hundreds of thousands of examples to extract the salient image features that are correlated with the outcome of interest. Higher placement on the machine learning spectrum does not imply superiority, because different tasks require different levels of human involvement. While algorithms high on the spectrum are often very flexible and can learn many tasks, they are often uninterpretable VIEWPOINT","Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)","2018","1267","['Medicine']","['JournalArticle']","2018-04-03","{'name': 'JAMA', 'pages': '\n          1317-1318\n        ', 'volume': '319 13'}","[{'authorId': '143649421', 'name': 'Andrew Beam'}, {'authorId': '1740538', 'name': 'I.

In recent years, applications of big data and AI in education have made significant headways. This highlights a novel trend in leading-edge educational research. The convenience and embeddedness of data collection within educational technologies, paired with computational techniques have made the analyses of big data a reality. We are moving beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations and applications of techniques, and are beginning to see substantial adoption in many areas of education. The key research trends in the domains of big data and AI are associated with assessment, individualized learning, and precision education. Model-driven data analytics approaches will grow quickly to guide the development, interpretation, and validation of the algorithms. However, conclusions from educational analytics should, of course, be applied with caution. At the education policy level, the government should be devoted to supporting lifelong learning, offering teacher education programs, and protecting personal data. With regard to the education industry, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationships should be developed in order to enhance academia-industry collaboration. Furthermore, it is important to make sure that technologies are guided by relevant theoretical frameworks and are empirically tested. Lastly, in this paper we advocate an in-depth dialog between supporters of “cold” technology and “warm” humanity so that it can lead to greater understanding among teachers and students about how technology, and specifically, the big data explosion and AI revolution can bring new opportunities (and challenges) that can be best leveraged for pedagogical practices and learning.","Frontiers in Psychology","2020","284","['Psychology', 'Medicine']","['Review', 'JournalArticle']","2020-10-19","{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '11'}","[{'authorId': '48803731', 'name': 'Hui Luan'}, {'authorId': '1804075', 'name': 'P.

When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment-the target experiment or target trial-that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.","American Journal of Epidemiology","2016","1608","['Medicine']","['JournalArticle']","2016-04-15","{'name': 'American journal of epidemiology', 'pages': '\n          758-64\n        ', 'volume': '183 8'}","[{'authorId': '40362338', 'name': 'M.

Central to this shift is the development of artificial intelligence approaches to implementing innovative modeling based on the dynamic, heterogeneous, and large nature of drug data sets. As a result, recently developed artificial intelligence approaches such as deep learning and relevant modeling studies provide new solutions to efficacy and safety evaluations of drug candidates based on big data modeling and analysis. The resulting models provided deep insights into the continuum from chemical structure to in vitro, in vivo, and clinical outcomes. The relevant novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recent modeling studies.

Digital traces of student behavior promise more scalable and finer-grained understanding and support of learning processes, which were previously too costly to obtain with traditional data sources and methodologies. This synthetic review describes the affordances and applications of microlevel (e.g., clickstream data), mesolevel (e.g., text data), and macrolevel (e.g., institutional data) big data. For instance, clickstream data are often used to operationalize and understand knowledge, cognitive strategies, and behavioral processes in order to personalize and enhance instruction and learning. Corpora of student writing are often analyzed with natural language processing techniques to relate linguistic features to cognitive, social, behavioral, and affective processes. Institutional data are often used to improve student and administrational decision making through course guidance systems and early-warning systems. Furthermore, this chapter outlines current challenges of accessing, analyzing, and using big data. Such challenges include balancing data privacy and protection with data sharing and research, training researchers in educational data science methodologies, and navigating the tensions between explanation and prediction. We argue that addressing these challenges is worthwhile given the potential benefits of mining big data in education.","Review of Research in Education","2020","221","['Psychology']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2020-03-01","{'name': 'Review of Research in Education', 'pages': '130 - 160', 'volume': '44'}","[{'authorId': '1567584468', 'name': 'Christian Fischer'}, {'authorId': '1743903', 'name': 'Z.

Despite several decades of research, ER remains a challenging problem. In this survey, we highlight the novel aspects of resolving Big Data entities when we should satisfy more than one of the Big Data characteristics simultaneously (i.e., Volume and Velocity with Variety). We present the basic concepts, processing steps, and execution strategies that have been proposed by database, semantic Web, and machine learning communities in order to cope with the loose structuredness, extreme diversity, high speed, and large scale of entity descriptions used by real-world applications. We provide an end-to-end view of ER workflows for Big Data, critically review the pros and cons of existing methods, and conclude with the main open research directions.","ACM Computing Surveys","2020","162","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2020-12-06","{'name': 'ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR)', 'pages': '1 - 42', 'volume': '53'}","[{'authorId': '3009404', 'name': 'V.

It has drawn considerable interest in the field of data mining and machine learning. Outlier detection is important in many applications, including fraud detection in credit card transactions and network intrusion detection. There are two general types of outlier detection: global and local. Global outliers fall outside the normal range for an entire dataset, whereas local outliers may fall within the normal range for the entire dataset, but outside the normal range for the surrounding data points. This paper addresses local outlier detection. The best-known technique for local outlier detection is the Local Outlier Factor (LOF), a density-based technique. There are many LOF algorithms for a static data environment; however, these algorithms cannot be applied directly to data streams, which are an important type of big data. In general, local outlier detection algorithms for data streams are still deficient and better algorithms need to be developed that can effectively analyze the high velocity of data streams to detect local outliers. This paper presents a literature review of local outlier detection algorithms in static and stream environments, with an emphasis on LOF algorithms. It collects and categorizes existing local outlier detection algorithms and analyzes their characteristics. Furthermore, the paper discusses the advantages and limitations of those algorithms and proposes several promising directions for developing improved local outlier detection methods for data streams.","Big Data and Cognitive Computing","2020","170","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2020-12-29","{'name': 'Big Data Cogn.

Drawing on the resource&#8208;based view, the dynamic capabilities view, and on recent literature on big data analytics, this study examines the indirect relationship between a big data analytics capability (BDAC) and two types of innovation capabilities: incremental and radical. The study extends existing research by proposing that BDACs enable firms to generate insight that can help strengthen their dynamic capabilities, which in turn positively impact incremental and radical innovation capabilities. To test their proposed research model, the authors used survey data from 175 chief information officers and IT managers working in Greek firms. By means of partial least squares structural equation modelling, the results confirm the authors&#8217; assumptions regarding the indirect effect that BDACs have on innovation capabilities. Specifically, they find that dynamic capabilities fully mediate the effect on both incremental and radical innovation capabilities. In addition, under conditions of high environmental heterogeneity, the impact of BDACs on dynamic capabilities and, in sequence, incremental innovation capability is enhanced, while under conditions of high environmental dynamism the effect of dynamic capabilities on incremental innovation capabilities is amplified.","British Journal of Management","2019","506","['Computer Science']","['Review']","2019-04-01","{'name': 'Change Management Strategy eJournal'}","[{'authorId': '2424691', 'name': 'Patrick Mikalef'}, {'authorId': '52222865', 'name': 'Maria Boura'}, {'authorId': '3357578', 'name': 'George Lekakos'}, {'authorId': '1716522', 'name': 'J.

In this paper, we describe the main developments since the previous update manuscript was published in Nucleic Acids Research in 2017. Since then, in addition to the four PX existing members at the time (PRIDE, PeptideAtlas including the PASSEL resource, MassIVE and jPOST), two new resources have joined PX: iProX (China) and Panorama Public (USA). We first describe the updated submission guidelines, now expanded to include six members. Next, with current data submission statistics, we demonstrate that the proteomics field is now actively embracing public open data policies. At the end of June 2019, more than 14 100 datasets had been submitted to PX resources since 2012, and from those, more than 9 500 in just the last three years. In parallel, an unprecedented increase of data re-use activities in the field, including ‘big data’ approaches, is enabling novel research and new data resources. At last, we also outline some of our future plans for the coming years.","Nucleic Acids Res.","2019","588","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Biology']","['JournalArticle']","2019-11-05","{'name': 'Nucleic Acids Research', 'pages': 'D1145 - D1152', 'volume': '48'}","[{'authorId': '1763674', 'name': 'E.

As Industry 4.0 is the relatively new concept originated from an advanced manufacturing vision supported by the German government in 2011, there are only several existing surveys on either cyber physical systems or big data in Industry 4.0. In addition, there are much less surveys related to the intersection between cyber physical systems and big data in Industry 4.0. However, cyber physical systems are closely related to big data in nature. For example, cyber physical systems will continuously generate a large amount of data which requires the big data techniques to process and help to improve system scalability, security, and efficiency. Therefore, we conduct this survey to bring more attention to this critical intersection and highlight the future research direction to achieve the fully autonomy in Industry 4.0.","Enterprise Information Systems","2019","423","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2019-02-07","{'name': 'Enterprise Information Systems', 'pages': '148 - 169', 'volume': '13'}","[{'authorId': '39466716', 'name': 'Lida Xu'}, {'authorId': '2055791334', 'name': 'Lian Duan'}]"

Tourists can now access different sources of information, and they can generate their own content and share their views and experiences. Tourism content shared through social media has become a very influential information source that impacts tourism in terms of both reputation and performance. However, the volume of data on the Internet has reached a level that makes manual processing almost impossible, demanding new analytical approaches. Sentiment analysis is rapidly emerging as an automated process of examining semantic relationships and meaning in reviews. In this article, different sentiment analysis approaches applied in tourism are reviewed and assessed in terms of the datasets used and performances on key evaluation metrics. The article concludes by outlining future research avenues to further advance sentiment analysis in tourism as part of a broader Big Data approach.","","2019","451","['Business']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2019-02-01","{'name': 'Journal of Travel Research', 'pages': '175 - 191', 'volume': '58'}","[{'authorId': '1971318', 'name': 'Alireza Alaei'}, {'authorId': '22271779', 'name': 'S.

However, the management of the knowledge generated from the BDA as well as its integration and combination with firm knowledge have scarcely been investigated, despite an emergent need of a structured and integrated approach. The paper aims to discuss these issues.   Design/methodology/approach Through an empirical analysis based on structural equation modelling with data collected from 88 Italian SMEs, the authors tested if BDA capabilities have a positive impact on firm performances, as well as the mediator effect of knowledge management (KM) on this relationship.   Findings The findings of this paper show that firms that developed more BDA capabilities than others, both technological and managerial, increased their performances and that KM orientation plays a significant role in amplifying the effect of BDA capabilities.   Originality/value BDA has the potential to change the way firms compete through better understanding, processing, and exploiting of huge amounts of data coming from different internal and external sources and processes. Some managerial and theoretical implications are proposed and discussed in light of the emergence of this new phenomenon.

In cluster computing, data partitioning and sampling are two fundamental strategies to speed up the computation of big data and increase scalability. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the methods and techniques of data partitioning and sampling with respect to big data processing and analysis. We start with an overview of the mainstream big data frameworks on Hadoop clusters. The basic methods of data partitioning are then discussed including three classical horizontal partitioning schemes: range, hash, and random partitioning. Data partitioning on Hadoop clusters is also discussed with a summary of new strategies for big data partitioning, including the new Random Sample Partition (RSP) distributed model. The classical methods of data sampling are then investigated, including simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and reservoir sampling. Two common methods of big data sampling on computing clusters are also discussed: record-level sampling and block-level sampling. Record-level sampling is not as efficient as block-level sampling on big distributed data. On the other hand, block-level sampling on data blocks generated with the classical data partitioning methods does not necessarily produce good representative samples for approximate computing of big data. In this survey, we also summarize the prevailing strategies and related work on sampling-based approximation on Hadoop clusters. We believe that data partitioning and sampling should be considered together to build approximate cluster computing frameworks that are reliable in both the computational and statistical respects.","Big Data Mining and Analytics","2020","166","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2020-02-27","{'name': 'Big Data Min.

Technological advancements such as next-generation sequencing, high-throughput omics data generation and molecular networks have catalysed IBD research. The advent of artificial intelligence, in particular, machine learning, and systems biology has opened the avenue for the efficient integration and interpretation of big datasets for discovering clinically translatable knowledge. In this narrative review, we discuss how big data integration and machine learning have been applied to translational IBD research. Approaches such as machine learning may enable patient stratification, prediction of disease progression and therapy responses for fine-tuning treatment options with positive impacts on cost, health and safety. We also outline the challenges and opportunities presented by machine learning and big data in clinical IBD research.","Gut","2020","141","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Review', 'JournalArticle']","2020-02-28","{'name': 'Gut', 'pages': '1520 - 1532', 'volume': '69'}","[{'authorId': '11918365', 'name': 'N.

Thus, new data-management architecture is needed. We proposed a building information model (BIM) big data-storage-management solution with hybrid storage architecture based on web virtual reality geographical information system (WebVRGIS). BIM is associated with the integration of spatial and semantic information on the various stages of urban building. In this paper, based on the spatial distribution characteristics of BIM geospatial big data, a data storage and management model is proposed for BIM geospatial big data management. The architecture primarily includes Not only Structured Query Language (NoSQL) database and distributed peer-to-peer storage. The evaluation of the proposed storage method is conducted on the same software platform as our previous research about WebVR. The experimental results show that the hybrid storage architecture proposed in this research has a lower response time compared to the traditional relational database in geospatial big data searches. The integration and fusion of BIM big data in WebVRGIS realizes a revolutionary transformation of city information management during a full lifecycle. The system also has great promise for the storage of other geospatial big data, such as traffic data.","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","2020","138","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2020-04-01","{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics', 'pages': '2566-2573', 'volume': '16'}","[{'authorId': '145772858', 'name': 'Zhihan Lv'}, {'authorId': '2116431916', 'name': 'Xiaoming Li'}, {'authorId': '38929912', 'name': 'Haibin Lv'}, {'authorId': '9138305', 'name': 'Wenqun Xiu'}]"

Most literature on BDA focuses on how it can be used to enhance tactical organizational capabilities, but very few studies examine its impact on organizational value. Further, we see limited framing of how BDA can create strategic value for the organization. After all, the ultimate success of any BDA project lies in realizing strategic business value, which gives firms a competitive advantage. In this study, we describe the value proposition of BDA by delineating its components. We offer a framing of BDA value by extending existing frameworks of information technology value, then illustrate the framework through BDA applications in practice. The framework is then discussed in terms of its ability to study constructs and relationships that focus on BDA value creation and realization. We also present a problem-oriented view of the framework—where problems in BDA components can give rise to targeted research questions and areas for future study. The framing in this study could help develop a significant research agenda for BDA that can better target research and practice based on effective use of data resources.","Journal of Management Information Systems","2018","655","['Computer Science', 'Business']","['JournalArticle']","2018-04-03","{'name': 'Journal of Management Information Systems', 'pages': '388 - 423', 'volume': '35'}","[{'authorId': '144894714', 'name': 'V.

The increasing of enormous smartphones, new complex scenarios, large frequency bands, massive antenna elements, and dense small cells will generate big datasets and bring 5G communications to the era of big data. This paper investigates various applications of big data analytics, especially machine learning algorithms in wireless communications and channel modeling. We propose a big data and machine learning enabled wireless channel model framework. The proposed channel model is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), including feed-forward neural network (FNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN). The input parameters are transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) coordinates, Tx–Rx distance, and carrier frequency, while the output parameters are channel statistical properties, including the received power, root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS), and RMS angle spreads (ASs). Datasets used to train and test the ANNs are collected from both real channel measurements and a geometry based stochastic model (GBSM). Simulation results show good performance and indicate that machine learning algorithms can be powerful analytical tools for future measurement-based wireless channel modeling.","IEEE Transactions on Big Data","2020","102","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['JournalArticle']","2020-02-28","{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Big Data', 'pages': '211-222', 'volume': '6'}","[{'authorId': '2144794493', 'name': 'Jie Huang'}, {'authorId': '2302556600', 'name': 'Cheng-Xiang Wang'}, {'authorId': '2075396941', 'name': 'L.

Despite the various advancements and the hopes of better understanding, big data management and analysis remain a challenge, calling for more rigorous and detailed research, as well as the identifications of methods and ways in which big data could be tackled and put to good use. The existing research lacks in discussing and evaluating the pertinent tools and technologies to analyze big data in an efficient manner which calls for a comprehensive and holistic analysis of the published articles to summarize the concept of big data and see field-specific applications. To address this gap and keep a recent focus, research articles published in last decade, belonging to top-tier and high-impact journals, were retrieved using the search engines of Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science that were narrowed down to a set of 139 relevant research articles. Different analyses were conducted on the retrieved papers including bibliometric analysis, keywords analysis, big data search trends, and authors’ names, countries, and affiliated institutes contributing the most to the field of big data. The comparative analyses show that, conceptually, big data lies at the intersection of the storage, statistics, technology, and research fields and emerged as an amalgam of these four fields with interlinked aspects such as data hosting and computing, data management, data refining, data patterns, and machine learning. The results further show that major characteristics of big data can be summarized using the seven Vs, which include variety, volume, variability, value, visualization, veracity, and velocity. Furthermore, the existing methods for big data analysis, their shortcomings, and the possible directions were also explored that could be taken for harnessing technology to ensure data analysis tools could be upgraded to be fast and efficient. The major challenges in handling big data include efficient storage, retrieval, analysis, and visualization of the large heterogeneous data, which can be tackled through authentication such as Kerberos and encrypted files, logging of attacks, secure communication through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), data imputation, building learning models, dividing computations into sub-tasks, checkpoint applications for recursive tasks, and using Solid State Drives (SDD) and Phase Change Material (PCM) for storage. In terms of frameworks for big data management, two frameworks exist including Hadoop and Apache Spark, which must be used simultaneously to capture the holistic essence of the data and make the analyses meaningful, swift, and speedy. Further field-specific applications of big data in two promising and integrated fields, i.e., smart real estate and disaster management, were investigated, and a framework for field-specific applications, as well as a merger of the two areas through big data, was highlighted. The proposed frameworks show that big data can tackle the ever-present issues of customer regrets related to poor quality of information or lack of information in smart real estate to increase the customer satisfaction using an intermediate organization that can process and keep a check on the data being provided to the customers by the sellers and real estate managers. Similarly, for disaster and its risk management, data from social media, drones, multimedia, and search engines can be used to tackle natural disasters such as floods, bushfires, and earthquakes, as well as plan emergency responses. In addition, a merger framework for smart real estate and disaster risk management show that big data generated from the smart real estate in the form of occupant data, facilities management, and building integration and maintenance can be shared with the disaster risk management and emergency response teams to help prevent, prepare, respond to, or recover from the disasters.","Big Data and Cognitive Computing","2020","116","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2020-03-26","{'name': 'Big Data Cogn.

In the meanwhile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process regression (GPR), a well-known nonparametric, and interpretable Bayesian model, which suffers from cubic complexity to data size. To improve the scalability while retaining desirable prediction quality, a variety of scalable GPs have been presented. However, they have not yet been comprehensively reviewed and analyzed to be well understood by both academia and industry. The review of scalable GPs in the GP community is timely and important due to the explosion of data size. To this end, this article is devoted to reviewing state-of-the-art scalable GPs involving two main categories: global approximations that distillate the entire data and local approximations that divide the data for subspace learning. Particularly, for global approximations, we mainly focus on sparse approximations comprising prior approximations that modify the prior but perform exact inference, posterior approximations that retain exact prior but perform approximate inference, and structured sparse approximations that exploit specific structures in kernel matrix; for local approximations, we highlight the mixture/product of experts that conducts model averaging from multiple local experts to boost predictions. To present a complete review, recent advances for improving the scalability and capability of scalable GPs are reviewed. Finally, the extensions and open issues of scalable GPs in various scenarios are reviewed and discussed to inspire novel ideas for future research avenues.","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","2018","653","['Medicine', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2018-07-03","{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems', 'pages': '4405-4423', 'volume': '31'}","[{'authorId': '2115552258', 'name': 'Haitao Liu'}, {'authorId': '144848119', 'name': 'Y.

The crisis is clearly spatial in nature, and examining the geographical aspect is important in understanding the broad implications of the pandemic. The avalanche of mobile Big Data makes it possible to study the spatial effects of the crisis with spatiotemporal detail at the national and global scales. However, the current crisis also highlights serious limitations in the readiness to take the advantage of mobile Big Data for social good, both within and beyond the interests of health sector. We propose two strategical pathways for the future use of mobile Big Data for societal impact assessment, addressing access to both raw mobile Big Data as well as aggregated data products. Both pathways require careful considerations of privacy issues, harmonized and transparent methodologies, and attention to the representativeness, reliability and continuity of data. The goal is to be better prepared to use mobile Big Data in future crises.","Big Data & Society","2020","69","['Geography']","['JournalArticle']","2020-07-01","{'name': 'Big Data & Society', 'volume': '7'}","[{'authorId': '101768561', 'name': 'A.

Based on the nature of the application, these devices will result in big or fast/real-time data streams. Applying analytics over such data streams to discover new information, predict future insights, and make control decisions is a crucial process that makes IoT a worthy paradigm for businesses and a quality-of-life improving technology. In this paper, we provide a thorough overview on using a class of advanced machine learning techniques, namely deep learning (DL), to facilitate the analytics and learning in the IoT domain. We start by articulating IoT data characteristics and identifying two major treatments for IoT data from a machine learning perspective, namely IoT big data analytics and IoT streaming data analytics. We also discuss why DL is a promising approach to achieve the desired analytics in these types of data and applications. The potential of using emerging DL techniques for IoT data analytics are then discussed, and its promises and challenges are introduced. We present a comprehensive background on different DL architectures and algorithms. We also analyze and summarize major reported research attempts that leveraged DL in the IoT domain. The smart IoT devices that have incorporated DL in their intelligence background are also discussed. DL implementation approaches on the fog and cloud centers in support of IoT applications are also surveyed. Finally, we shed light on some challenges and potential directions for future research.

However, there is little research on medical big data (MBD) from the perspectives of bibliometrics and visualization. The substantive research on the basic aspects of MBD itself is also rare. This study aims to explore the current status of medical big data through visualization analysis on the journal papers related to MBD. We analyze a total of 988 references which were downloaded from the Science Citation Index Expanded and the Social Science Citation Index databases from Web of Science and the time span was defined as “all years”. The GraphPad Prism 5, VOSviewer and CiteSpace softwares are used for analysis. Many results concerning the annual trends, the top players in terms of journal and institute levels, the citations and H-index in terms of country level, the keywords distribution, the highly cited papers, the co-authorship status and the most influential journals and authors are presented in this paper. This study points out the development status and trends on MBD. It can help people in the medical profession to get comprehensive understanding on the state of the art of MBD. It also has reference values for the research and application of the MBD visualization methods.","","2018","558","['Economics']","","2018-01-11","{'name': 'Sustainability', 'pages': '1-18', 'volume': '10'}","[{'authorId': '2314246', 'name': 'Huchang Liao'}, {'authorId': '2087083011', 'name': 'Ming Tang'}, {'authorId': '8043060', 'name': 'L.

As scientists, we now have the capacity to rapidly generate, store and analyse data that, only a few years ago, would have taken many years to compile. However, “Big data” no longer means what it once did. The term has expanded and now refers not to just large data volume, but to our increasing ability to analyse and interpret those data. Tautologies such as “data analytics” and “data science” have emerged to describe approaches to the volume of available information as it grows ever larger. New methods dedicated to improving data collection, storage, cleaning, processing and interpretation continue to be developed, although not always by, or for, medical researchers. Exploiting new tools to extract meaning from large volume information has the potential to drive real change in clinical practice, from personalized therapy and intelligent drug design to population screening and electronic health record mining. As ever, where new technology promises “Big Advances,” significant challenges remain. Here we discuss both the opportunities and challenges posed to biomedical research by our increasing ability to tackle large datasets. Important challenges include the need for standardization of data content, format, and clinical definitions, a heightened need for collaborative networks with sharing of both data and expertise and, perhaps most importantly, a need to reconsider how and when analytic methodology is taught to medical researchers. We also set “Big data” analytics in context: recent advances may appear to promise a revolution, sweeping away conventional approaches to medical science. However, their real promise lies in their synergy with, not replacement of, classical hypothesis-driven methods. The generation of novel, data-driven hypotheses based on interpretable models will always require stringent validation and experimental testing. Thus, hypothesis-generating research founded on large datasets adds to, rather than replaces, traditional hypothesis driven science. Each can benefit from the other and it is through using both that we can improve clinical practice.","Frontiers in Medicine","2019","344","['Medicine', 'Computer Science']","['Review', 'JournalArticle']","2019-03-01","{'name': 'Frontiers in Medicine', 'volume': '6'}","[{'authorId': '2193799', 'name': 'Tim Hulsen'}, {'authorId': '34734228', 'name': 'S.
