The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.","arXiv.org","2023","2713","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2023-03-22","{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume': 'abs/2303.12712'}","[{'authorId': '121645690', 'name': 'Sébastien Bubeck'}, {'authorId': '143754359', 'name': 'Varun Chandrasekaran'}, {'authorId': '2315830', 'name': 'Ronen Eldan'}, {'authorId': '120962807', 'name': 'J.

However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.","IEEE Access","2018","3601","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2018-09-17","{'name': 'IEEE Access', 'pages': '52138-52160', 'volume': '6'}","[{'authorId': '9139705', 'name': 'Amina Adadi'}, {'authorId': '50487490', 'name': 'M.

Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications.  In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics.  Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements.  John H. Holland is Professor of Psychology and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. He is also Maxwell Professor at the Santa Fe Institute and isDirector of the University of Michigan/Santa Fe Institute Advanced Research Program.","","1992","40093","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","","1992-05-01","{'name': '', 'volume': ''}","[{'authorId': '144404817', 'name': 'J.

In a preregistered online experiment, we assigned occupation-specific, incentivized writing tasks to 453 college-educated professionals and randomly exposed half of them to ChatGPT. Our results show that ChatGPT substantially raised productivity: The average time taken decreased by 40% and output quality rose by 18%. Inequality between workers decreased, and concern and excitement about AI temporarily rose. Workers exposed to ChatGPT during the experiment were 2 times as likely to report using it in their real job 2 weeks after the experiment and 1.6 times as likely 2 months after the experiment. Description Editor’s summary Automation has historically displaced human workers in factories (e.g., automotive manufacturing) or in performing routine computational tasks. Will generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT disrupt the labor market by making educated professionals obsolete, or will these tools complement their skills and enhance productivity? Noy and Zhang examined this issue in an experiment that recruited college-educated professionals to complete incentivized writing tasks. Participants assigned to use ChatGPT were more productive, efficient, and enjoyed the tasks more. Participants with weaker skills benefited the most from ChatGPT, which carries policy implications for efforts to reduce productivity inequality through AI. —EEU The assistive chatbot ChatGPT raises productivity in professional writing tasks and reduces productivity inequality.","Science","2023","499","['Medicine']","['JournalArticle']","2023-07-14","{'name': 'Science', 'pages': '187 - 192', 'volume': '381'}","[{'authorId': '119462164', 'name': 'Shakked Noy'}, {'authorId': '123247135', 'name': 'Whitney Zhang'}]"

Therefore, AI ethics, which is a field related to the study of ethical issues in AI, has become not only an important research topic in academia, but also an important topic of common concern for individuals, organizations, countries, and society. This article will give a comprehensive overview of this field by summarizing and analyzing the ethical risks and issues raised by AI, ethical guidelines and principles issued by different organizations, approaches for addressing ethical issues in AI, and methods for evaluating the ethics of AI. Additionally, challenges in implementing ethics in AI and some future perspectives are pointed out. We hope our work will provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of AI ethics for researchers and practitioners in this field, especially the beginners of this research discipline.","IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence","2023","87","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2023-08-01","{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence', 'pages': '799-819', 'volume': '4'}","[{'authorId': '15913738', 'name': 'Changwu Huang'}, {'authorId': '2118689474', 'name': 'Zeqi Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2105731841', 'name': 'Bifei Mao'}, {'authorId': '2115585545', 'name': 'X.

More recently, with the proliferation of mobile computing and Internet of Things (IoT), billions of mobile and IoT devices are connected to the Internet, generating zillions bytes of data at the network edge. Driving by this trend, there is an urgent need to push the AI frontiers to the network edge so as to fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. To meet this demand, edge computing, an emerging paradigm that pushes computing tasks and services from the network core to the network edge, has been widely recognized as a promising solution. The resulted new interdiscipline, edge AI or edge intelligence (EI), is beginning to receive a tremendous amount of interest. However, research on EI is still in its infancy stage, and a dedicated venue for exchanging the recent advances of EI is highly desired by both the computer system and AI communities. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent research efforts on EI. Specifically, we first review the background and motivation for AI running at the network edge. We then provide an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and emerging key technologies for deep learning model toward training/inference at the network edge. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities on EI. We believe that this survey will elicit escalating attentions, stimulate fruitful discussions, and inspire further research ideas on EI.","Proceedings of the IEEE","2019","1356","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2019-05-24","{'name': 'Proceedings of the IEEE', 'pages': '1738-1762', 'volume': '107'}","[{'authorId': '145447664', 'name': 'Zhi Zhou'}, {'authorId': '1712187180', 'name': 'Xu Chen'}, {'authorId': '2053811799', 'name': 'En Li'}, {'authorId': '123047372', 'name': 'Liekang Zeng'}, {'authorId': '48181063', 'name': 'Ke Luo'}, {'authorId': '47540395', 'name': 'Junshan Zhang'}]"

The research explores Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) for building personalised learning systems for students. The research investigates and proposes a framework for AIEd: social networking sites and chatbots, expert systems for education, intelligent mentors and agents, machine learning, personalised educational systems and virtual educational environments. These technologies help educators to develop and introduce personalised approaches to master new knowledge and develop professional competencies. The research presents a case study of AIEd implementation in education. The scholars conducted the experiment in educational establishments using artificial intelligence in the curriculum. The scholars surveyed 184 second-year students of the Institute of Pedagogy and Psychology at the Abay Kazakh National Pedagogical University and the Kuban State Technological University to collect the data. The scholars considered the collective group discussions regarding the application of artificial intelligence in education to improve the effectiveness of learning. The research identified key advantages to creating personalised learning pathways such as access to training in 24/7 mode, training in virtual contexts, adaptation of educational content to personal needs of students, real-time and regular feedback, improvements in the educational process and mental stimulations. The proposed education paradigm reflects the increasing role of artificial intelligence in socio-economic life, the social and ethical concerns artificial intelligence may pose to humanity and its role in the digitalisation of education. The current article may be used as a theoretical framework for many educational institutions planning to exploit the capabilities of artificial intelligence in their adaptation to personalized learning.","Electronic Journal of e-Learning","2022","169","","['Review']","2022-12-09","{'name': 'Electronic Journal of e-Learning'}","[{'authorId': '117460583', 'name': 'Olga Tapalova'}, {'authorId': '114349563', 'name': 'N.

"573e6814c16178186daf537b1e1a5d3c840eef2f","","Artificial Intelligence in Service","Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping service by performing various tasks, constituting a major source of innovation, yet threatening human jobs. We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks—mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic—and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for “lower” (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job’s tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job’s tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the “softer” intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human–machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment.","","2018","1861","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2018-02-05","{'name': 'Journal of Service Research', 'pages': '155 - 172', 'volume': '21'}","[{'authorId': '50474058', 'name': 'Ming-Hui Huang'}, {'authorId': '1813939', 'name': 'R.

The sample consisted of 259 female (74%) and 91 male (26%) individuals aged between 18 and 51 (Mean = 24.23). Measures taken were demographics, the Ten-Item Personality Inventory, the Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale, and the General Attitudes toward Artificial Intelligence Scale. The Turkish GAAIS had good validity and reliability. Hierarchical Multiple Linear Regression Analyses showed that positive attitudes toward artificial intelligence were significantly predicted by the level of computer use (β = 0.139, p = 0.013), level of knowledge about artificial intelligence (β = 0.119, p = 0.029), and AI learning anxiety (β = −0.172, p = 0.004). Negative attitudes toward artificial intelligence were significantly predicted by agreeableness (β = 0.120, p = 0.019), AI configuration anxiety (β = −0.379, p < 0.001), and AI learning anxiety (β = −0.211, p < 0.001). Personality traits, AI anxiety, and demographics play important roles in attitudes toward AI. Results are discussed in light of the previous research and theoretical explanations.","International journal of human computer interactions","2022","153","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2022-12-07","{'name': 'International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction', 'pages': '497 - 514', 'volume': '40'}","[{'authorId': '2072226241', 'name': 'Feridun Kaya'}, {'authorId': '34909038', 'name': 'F.

Due to the rapid development of Internet-connected systems and Artificial Intelligence in recent years, Artificial Intelligence including Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) has been widely utilized in the fields of cyber security including intrusion detection, malware detection, and spam filtering. However, although Artificial Intelligence-based approaches for the detection and defense of cyber attacks and threats are more advanced and efficient compared to the conventional signature-based and rule-based cyber security strategies, most ML-based techniques and DL-based techniques are deployed in the “black-box” manner, meaning that security experts and customers are unable to explain how such procedures reach particular conclusions. The deficiencies of transparencies and interpretability of existing Artificial Intelligence techniques would decrease human users’ confidence in the models utilized for the defense against cyber attacks, especially in current situations where cyber attacks become increasingly diverse and complicated. Therefore, it is essential to apply XAI in the establishment of cyber security models to create more explainable models while maintaining high accuracy and allowing human users to comprehend, trust, and manage the next generation of cyber defense mechanisms. Although there are papers reviewing Artificial Intelligence applications in cyber security areas and the vast literature on applying XAI in many fields including healthcare, financial services, and criminal justice, the surprising fact is that there are currently no survey research articles that concentrate on XAI applications in cyber security. Therefore, the motivation behind the survey is to bridge the research gap by presenting a detailed and up-to-date survey of XAI approaches applicable to issues in the cyber security field. Our work is the first to propose a clear roadmap for navigating the XAI literature in the context of applications in cyber security.","IEEE Access","2022","124","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2022-08-31","{'name': 'IEEE Access', 'pages': '93104-93139', 'volume': '10'}","[{'authorId': '2180312550', 'name': 'Zhibo Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2738833', 'name': 'H.

The Current Growth of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning","In the modern era, many terms related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are widely used in domains such as business, healthcare, industries, and military. In these fields, the accurate prediction and analysis of data are crucial, regardless of how large the data are. However, using big data is confusing due to the rapid growth and massive development in public life, which requires a tremendous human effort in order to deal with such type of data and extract worthy information from it. Thus, the role of artificial intelligence begins in analyzing big data based on scientific techniques, especially in machine learning, whereby it can identify patterns of decision-making and reduce human intervention. In this regard, the significance role of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning is growing rapidly. In this article, the authors decide to highlight these sciences by discussing how to develop and apply them in many decision-making domains. In addition, the influence of artificial intelligence in healthcare and the gains this science provides in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic are highlighted. This article concludes that these sciences have a significant impact, especially in healthcare, as well as the ability to grow and improve their methodology in decision-making. Additionally, artificial intelligence is a vital science, especially in the face of COVID-19.","Iraqi Journal for Computer Science and Mathematics","2022","164","","","2022-01-30","{'name': 'Iraqi Journal for Computer Science and Mathematics'}","[{'authorId': '1394846990', 'name': 'Maad M.

Unlike the perception of healthcare professionals, the attitudes of patients and their companions have been of less interest so far. In this study, we aimed to investigate the perception of artificial intelligence in healthcare among this highly relevant group along with the influence of digital affinity and sociodemographic factors. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study using a paper-based questionnaire with patients and their companions at a German tertiary referral hospital from December 2019 to February 2020. The questionnaire consisted of three sections examining (a) the respondents’ technical affinity, (b) their perception of different aspects of artificial intelligence in healthcare and (c) sociodemographic characteristics. Results From a total of 452 participants, more than 90% already read or heard about artificial intelligence, but only 24% reported good or expert knowledge. Asked on their general perception, 53.18% of the respondents rated the use of artificial intelligence in medicine as positive or very positive, but only 4.77% negative or very negative. The respondents denied concerns about artificial intelligence, but strongly agreed that artificial intelligence must be controlled by a physician. Older patients, women, persons with lower education and technical affinity were more cautious on the healthcare-related artificial intelligence usage. Conclusions German patients and their companions are open towards the usage of artificial intelligence in healthcare. Although showing only a mediocre knowledge about artificial intelligence, a majority rated artificial intelligence in healthcare as positive. Particularly, patients insist that a physician supervises the artificial intelligence and keeps ultimate responsibility for diagnosis and therapy.","Digital Health","2022","90","['Medicine']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2022-01-01","{'name': 'Digital Health', 'volume': '8'}","[{'authorId': '50164013', 'name': 'S.

It has been envisioned that 6G will be transformative and will revolutionize the evolution of wireless from “connected things” to “connected intelligence”. However, state-of-the-art deep learning and big data analytics based AI systems require tremendous computation and communication resources, causing significant latency, energy consumption, network congestion, and privacy leakage in both of the training and inference processes. By embedding model training and inference capabilities into the network edge, edge AI stands out as a disruptive technology for 6G to seamlessly integrate sensing, communication, computation, and intelligence, thereby improving the efficiency, effectiveness, privacy, and security of 6G networks. In this paper, we shall provide our vision for scalable and trustworthy edge AI systems with integrated design of wireless communication strategies and decentralized machine learning models. New design principles of wireless networks, service-driven resource allocation optimization methods, as well as a holistic end-to-end system architecture to support edge AI will be described. Standardization, software and hardware platforms, and application scenarios are also discussed to facilitate the industrialization and commercialization of edge AI systems.","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","2021","373","['Computer Science', 'Engineering', 'Mathematics']","['JournalArticle']","2021-11-24","{'name': 'IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications', 'pages': '5-36', 'volume': '40'}","[{'authorId': '145142172', 'name': 'K.

This study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for HRM. In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research.","International journal of human resources management","2021","521","['Engineering']","['Review']","2021-02-12","{'name': 'The International Journal of Human Resource Management', 'pages': '1237 - 1266', 'volume': '33'}","[{'authorId': '144031328', 'name': 'D.

This review shows that artificial intelligence and the use of neural networks has developed very rapidly in recent years, and it may be an ordinary tool in modern dentistry in the near future. The advantages of this process are better efficiency, accuracy, and time saving during the diagnosis and treatment planning. More research and improvements are needed in the use of neural networks in dentistry to put them into daily practice and to facilitate the work of the dentist.","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","2022","97","['Medicine']","['Review', 'JournalArticle']","2022-03-01","{'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health', 'volume': '19'}","[{'authorId': '108108559', 'name': 'Agata Ossowska'}, {'authorId': '49913591', 'name': 'A.

Along with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and disciplines. Some of them require high level of accountability and thus transparency, for example, the medical sector. Explanations for machine decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the DL is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different research works and categorize them. The different categories show different dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide “obviously” interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is hoped that: 1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these methods with caution; 2) insight into interpretability will be born with more considerations for medical practices; and 3) initiatives to push forward data-based, mathematically grounded, and technically grounded medical education are encouraged.","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","2019","1305","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2019-07-17","{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems', 'pages': '4793-4813', 'volume': '32'}","[{'authorId': '71352570', 'name': 'Erico Tjoa'}, {'authorId': '145836900', 'name': 'Cuntai Guan'}]"

Clinicians may also serve as administrators in governing the use of clinical AI. A natural question follows: are clinicians adequately prepared to identify circumstances in which AI systems fail to perform their intended function reliably? A major driver of AI system malfunction is known as “dataset shift.”4,5 Most clinical AI systems today use machine learning, algorithms that leverage statistical methods to learn key patterns from clinical data. Dataset shift occurs when a machine-learning system underperforms because of a mismatch between the data set with which it was developed and the data on which it is deployed.4 For example, the University of Michigan Hospital implemented the widely used sepsis-alerting model developed by Epic Systems; in April 2020, the model had to be deactivated because of spurious alerting owing to changes in patients’ demographic characteristics associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This was a case in which dataset shift fundamentally altered the relationship between fevers and bacterial sepsis, leading the hospital’s clinical AI governing committee (which one of the authors of this letter chairs) to decommission its use. This is an extreme example; many causes of dataset shift are more subtle. In Table 1, we present common causes of dataset shift, which we group into changes in technology (e.g., software vendors), changes in population and setting (e.g., new demographics), and changes in behavior (e.g., new reimbursement incentives); the list is not meant to be exhaustive. Successful recognition and mitigation of dataset shift require both vigilant clinicians and sound technical oversight through AI governance teams.4,5 When using an AI system, clinicians should note misalignment between the predictions of the model and their own clinical judgment, as in the sepsis example above. Clinicians who use AI systems must frequently consider whether relevant aspects of their own clinical practice are atypical or have recently changed. For their part, AI governance teams must be sure that it is easy for clinicians to report concerns about the function of AI systems and provide feedback so that the clinician who is reporting will understand that the registered concern has been noted and, if appropriate, actions to mitigate the concern have been taken. Teams must also establish AI monitoring and updating protocols that integrate technical solu-","New England Journal of Medicine","2021","350","['Medicine']","['LettersAndComments']","2021-07-15","{'name': 'The New England journal of medicine', 'pages': '\n          283-286\n        ', 'volume': '385 3'}","[{'authorId': '50478054', 'name': 'S.
