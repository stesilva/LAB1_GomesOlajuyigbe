To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN), most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically, VoxelNet divides a point cloud into equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a descriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to generate detections. Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that VoxelNet outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a large margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative representation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging results in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR.","2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","2017.0","3481","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Conference']","2017-11-17","{'name': '2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'pages': '4490-4499'}","[{'authorId': '2118860832', 'name': 'Yin Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2577513', 'name': 'Oncel Tuzel'}]"

The whole framework is composed of two stages: stage-1 for the bottom-up 3D proposal generation and stage-2 for refining proposals in the canonical coordinates to obtain the final detection results. Instead of generating proposals from RGB image or projecting point cloud to bird's view or voxels as previous methods do, our stage-1 sub-network directly generates a small number of high-quality 3D proposals from point cloud in a bottom-up manner via segmenting the point cloud of the whole scene into foreground points and background. The stage-2 sub-network transforms the pooled points of each proposal to canonical coordinates to learn better local spatial features, which is combined with global semantic features of each point learned in stage-1 for accurate box refinement and confidence prediction. Extensive experiments on the 3D detection benchmark of KITTI dataset show that our proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods with remarkable margins by using only point cloud as input.

"1f7190fc294246f83f1f331cc51e3264851d0d36","","Above the Clouds: A Berkeley View of Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing, the long-held dream of computing as a utility, has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT hardware is designed and purchased. Developers with innovative ideas for new Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about overprovisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or underprovisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours. This elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for large scale, is unprecedented in the history of IT. Cloud Computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the hardware and systems software in the datacenters that provide those services. The services themselves have long been referred to as Software as a Service (SaaS). The datacenter hardware and software is what we will call a Cloud. When a Cloud is made available in a pay-as-you-go manner to the general public, we call it a Public Cloud; the service being sold is Utility Computing. We use the term Private Cloud to refer to internal datacenters of a business or other organization, not made available to the general public. Thus, Cloud Computing is the sum of SaaS and Utility Computing, but does not include Private Clouds. People can be users or providers of SaaS, or users or providers of Utility Computing. We focus on SaaS Providers (Cloud Users) and Cloud Providers, which have received less attention than SaaS Users. From a hardware point of view, three aspects are new in Cloud Computing.","","2009.0","7371","['Computer Science']","","","{'name': 'Science', 'pages': '07-013', 'volume': '53'}","[{'authorId': '144482217', 'name': 'Michael Armbrust'}, {'authorId': '143608596', 'name': 'A.

It can leverage virtualized services even on the fly based on requirements (workload patterns and QoS) varying with time. The application services hosted under Cloud computing model have complex provisioning, composition, configuration, and deployment requirements. Evaluating the performance of Cloud provisioning policies, application workload models, and resources performance models in a repeatable manner under varying system and user configurations and requirements is difficult to achieve. To overcome this challenge, we propose CloudSim: an extensible simulation toolkit that enables modeling and simulation of Cloud computing systems and application provisioning environments. The CloudSim toolkit supports both system and behavior modeling of Cloud system components such as data centers, virtual machines (VMs) and resource provisioning policies. It implements generic application provisioning techniques that can be extended with ease and limited effort. Currently, it supports modeling and simulation of Cloud computing environments consisting of both single and inter‐networked clouds (federation of clouds). Moreover, it exposes custom interfaces for implementing policies and provisioning techniques for allocation of VMs under inter‐networked Cloud computing scenarios. Several researchers from organizations, such as HP Labs in U.S.A., are using CloudSim in their investigation on Cloud resource provisioning and energy‐efficient management of data center resources. The usefulness of CloudSim is demonstrated by a case study involving dynamic provisioning of application services in the hybrid federated clouds environment. The result of this case study proves that the federated Cloud computing model significantly improves the application QoS requirements under fluctuating resource and service demand patterns.

These newer systems address ""cloud OLTP"" applications, though they typically do not support ACID transactions. Examples of systems proposed for cloud serving use include BigTable, PNUTS, Cassandra, HBase, Azure, CouchDB, SimpleDB, Voldemort, and many others. Further, they are being applied to a diverse range of applications that differ considerably from traditional (e.g., TPC-C like) serving workloads. The number of emerging cloud serving systems and the wide range of proposed applications, coupled with a lack of apples-to-apples performance comparisons, makes it difficult to understand the tradeoffs between systems and the workloads for which they are suited. We present the ""Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark"" (YCSB) framework, with the goal of facilitating performance comparisons of the new generation of cloud data serving systems. We define a core set of benchmarks and report results for four widely used systems: Cassandra, HBase, Yahoo!'s PNUTS, and a simple sharded MySQL implementation. We also hope to foster the development of additional cloud benchmark suites that represent other classes of applications by making our benchmark tool available via open source. In this regard, a key feature of the YCSB framework/tool is that it is extensible--it supports easy definition of new workloads, in addition to making it easy to benchmark new systems.","ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing","2010.0","3723","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2010-06-10","{'pages': '143-154'}","[{'authorId': '2780009', 'name': 'Brian F.

Six forms of water substance (water vapor, cloud water, cloud ice, rain, snow and hail, i.e., graupel) are simulated. The model utilizes the “bulk water” microphysical parameterization technique to represent the precipitation fields which are all assumed to follow exponential size distribution functions. Autoconversion concepts are used to parameterize the collision-coalescence and collision-aggregation processes. Accretion processes involving the various forms of liquid and solid hydrometeors are simulated in this model. The transformation of cloud ice to snow through autoconversion (aggregation) and Bergeron process and subsequent accretional growth or aggregation to form hail are simulated.

Inspired by BERT, we devise a Masked Point Modeling (MPM) task to pre-train point cloud Transformers. Specifically, we first divide a point cloud into several local point patches, and a point cloud Tokenizer with a discrete Variational AutoEncoder (dVAE) is designed to generate discrete point tokens containing meaningful local information. Then, we randomly mask out some patches of input point clouds and feed them into the backbone Transformers. The pre-training objective is to recover the original point tokens at the masked locations under the supervision of point tokens obtained by the Tokenizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BERT-style pre-training strategy significantly improves the performance of standard point cloud Transformers. Equipped with our pre-training strategy, we show that a pure Transformer architecture attains 93.8% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 83.1% accuracy on the hardest setting of ScanObjectNN, surpassing carefully designed point cloud models with much fewer hand-made designs. We also demonstrate that the representations learned by Point-BERT transfer well to new tasks and domains, where our models largely advance the state-of-the-art of few-shot point cloud classification task.

Point cloud generation thus amounts to learning the reverse diffusion process that transforms the noise distribution to the distribution of a desired shape. Specifically, we propose to model the reverse diffusion process for point clouds as a Markov chain conditioned on certain shape latent. We derive the variational bound in closed form for training and provide implementations of the model.

By rep-resenting the point cloud as a set of unordered groups of points with position embeddings, we convert the point cloud to a sequence of point proxies and employ the transformers for point cloud generation. To facilitate transformers to better leverage the inductive bias about 3D geometric structures of point clouds, we further devise a geometry-aware block that models the local geometric relationships explicitly. The migration of transformers enables our model to better learn structural knowledge and preserve detailed information for point cloud completion. Furthermore, we propose two more challenging benchmarks with more diverse incomplete point clouds that can better reflect the real-world scenarios to promote future research. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on both the new bench-marks and the existing ones.

In this paper, we first study the multi-user computation offloading problem for mobile-edge cloud computing in a multi-channel wireless interference environment. We show that it is NP-hard to compute a centralized optimal solution, and hence adopt a game theoretic approach for achieving efficient computation offloading in a distributed manner. We formulate the distributed computation offloading decision making problem among mobile device users as a multi-user computation offloading game. We analyze the structural property of the game and show that the game admits a Nash equilibrium and possesses the finite improvement property. We then design a distributed computation offloading algorithm that can achieve a Nash equilibrium, derive the upper bound of the convergence time, and quantify its efficiency ratio over the centralized optimal solutions in terms of two important performance metrics. We further extend our study to the scenario of multi-user computation offloading in the multi-channel wireless contention environment. Numerical results corroborate that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior computation offloading performance and scale well as the user size increases.","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","2015.0","2114","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2015-10-04","{'name': 'IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking', 'pages': '2795-2808', 'volume': '24'}","[{'authorId': '2144230079', 'name': 'Xu Chen'}, {'authorId': '40657800', 'name': 'Lei Jiao'}, {'authorId': '1715356', 'name': 'Wenzhong Li'}, {'authorId': '1799074', 'name': 'Xiaoming Fu'}]"

Several recent 3D object classification methods have reported state-of-the-art performance on CAD model datasets such as ModelNet40 with high accuracy (~92\%). Despite such impressive results, in this paper, we argue that object classification is still a challenging task when objects are framed with real-world settings. To prove this, we introduce ScanObjectNN, a new real-world point cloud object dataset based on scanned indoor scene data. From our comprehensive benchmark, we show that our dataset poses great challenges to existing point cloud classification techniques as objects from real-world scans are often cluttered with background and/or are partial due to occlusions.

In this work, a novel end-to-end deep auto-encoder is proposed to address unsupervised learning challenges on point clouds. On the encoder side, a graph-based enhancement is enforced to promote local structures on top of PointNet. Then, a novel folding-based decoder deforms a canonical 2D grid onto the underlying 3D object surface of a point cloud, achieving low reconstruction errors even for objects with delicate structures. The proposed decoder only uses about 7% parameters of a decoder with fully-connected neural networks, yet leads to a more discriminative representation that achieves higher linear SVM classification accuracy than the benchmark. In addition, the proposed decoder structure is shown, in theory, to be a generic architecture that is able to reconstruct an arbitrary point cloud from a 2D grid.

The buzz around cloud computing has reached a fever pitch. Some believe it is a disruptive trend representing the next stage in the evolution of the internet. Others believe it is hype, as it uses long established computing technologies. One thing is clear: The industry needs an objective, straightforward conversation about how this new computing paradigm will impact organizations, how it can be used with existing technologies, and the potential pitfalls of proprietary technologies that can lead to lock-in and limited choice. This document is intended to initiate a conversation that will bring together the emerging cloud computing community (both cloud users and cloud vendors) around a core set of principles. We believe that these core principles are rooted in the belief that cloud computing should be as open as all other IT technologies. This document does not intend to define a final taxonomy of cloud computing or to charter a new standards effort. Nor does it try to be an exhaustive thesis on cloud architecture and design. Rather, this document speaks to CIOs and other business leaders who intend to use cloud computing and to establish a set of core principles for cloud vendors. Cloud computing is still in its early stages, with much to learn and more experimentation to come. However, the time is right for the members of the emerging cloud computing community to come together around the notion of an open cloud.","International Conference & Workshop on Emerging Trends in Technology","2010.0","3185","['Computer Science']","['Book', 'JournalArticle']","2010-02-26","{'name': 'Proceedings of the International Conference and Workshop on Emerging Trends in Technology'}","[{'authorId': '1890685', 'name': 'P.

Specifically, our PointNetVLAD is a combination/modification of the existing PointNet and NetVLAD, which allows end-to-end training and inference to extract the global descriptor from a given 3D point cloud. Furthermore, we propose the ""lazy triplet and quadruplet"" loss functions that can achieve more discriminative and generalizable global descriptors to tackle the retrieval task.

Previous works assume one central parameter server either at the cloud or at the edge. The cloud server can access more data but with excessive communication overhead and long latency, while the edge server enjoys more efficient communications with the clients. To combine their advantages, we propose a client-edge-cloud hierarchical Federated Learning system, supported with a HierFAVG algorithm that allows multiple edge servers to perform partial model aggregation. In this way, the model can be trained faster and better communication-computation trade-offs can be achieved. Convergence analysis is provided for HierFAVG and the effects of key parameters are also investigated, which lead to qualitative design guidelines. Empirical experiments verify the analysis and demonstrate the benefits of this hierarchical architecture in different data distribution scenarios. Particularly, it is shown that by introducing the intermediate edge servers, the model training time and the energy consumption of the end devices can be simultaneously reduced compared to cloud-based Federated Learning.","ICC 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","2019.0","666","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Conference']","2019-05-16","{'name': 'ICC 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)', 'pages': '1-6'}","[{'authorId': '2118467847', 'name': 'Lumin Liu'}, {'authorId': None, 'name': 'Jun Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2107567409', 'name': 'S.

In this paper, we examine the status quo approach of cloud-only processing and investigate computation partitioning strategies that effectively leverage both the cycles in the cloud and on the mobile device to achieve low latency, low energy consumption, and high datacenter throughput for this class of intelligent applications. Our study uses 8 intelligent applications spanning computer vision, speech, and natural language domains, all employing state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as the core machine learning technique. We find that given the characteristics of DNN algorithms, a fine-grained, layer-level computation partitioning strategy based on the data and computation variations of each layer within a DNN has significant latency and energy advantages over the status quo approach. Using this insight, we design Neurosurgeon, a lightweight scheduler to automatically partition DNN computation between mobile devices and datacenters at the granularity of neural network layers. Neurosurgeon does not require per-application profiling. It adapts to various DNN architectures, hardware platforms, wireless networks, and server load levels, intelligently partitioning computation for best latency or best mobile energy. We evaluate Neurosurgeon on a state-of-the-art mobile development platform and show that it improves end-to-end latency by 3.1X on average and up to 40.7X, reduces mobile energy consumption by 59.5% on average and up to 94.7%, and improves datacenter throughput by 1.5X on average and up to 6.7X.","International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","2017.0","1143","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Book', 'Conference']","2017-04-04","{'name': 'Proceedings of the Twenty-Second International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems'}","[{'authorId': '2085723', 'name': 'Yiping Kang'}, {'authorId': '2546385', 'name': 'Johann Hauswald'}, {'authorId': '2443277', 'name': 'Cao Gao'}, {'authorId': '1860422', 'name': 'A.

Unlike previous work, we densely connect each point with every other in a local neighborhood, aiming to specify feature of each point based on the local region characteristics for better representing the region. A novel module, namely Adaptive Feature Adjustment (AFA) module, is presented to find the interaction between points. For each local region, an impact map carrying element-wise impact between point pairs is applied to the feature difference map. Each feature is then pulled or pushed by other features in the same region according to the adaptively learned impact indicators. The adjusted features are well encoded with region information, and thus benefit the point cloud recognition tasks, such as point cloud segmentation and classification. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-arts on both semantic segmentation and shape classification datasets.","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","2019.0","632","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Conference']","2019-06-01","{'name': '2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)', 'pages': '5560-5568'}","[{'authorId': '3459894', 'name': 'Hengshuang Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2108810714', 'name': 'Li Jiang'}, {'authorId': '144856288', 'name': 'Chi-Wing Fu'}, {'authorId': '1729056', 'name': 'Jiaya Jia'}]"

This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation. In addition, we reveal our early thoughts on interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating global Cloud exchanges and markets. Then, we present some representative Cloud platforms, especially those developed in industries, along with our current work towards realizing market-oriented resource allocation of Clouds as realized in Aneka enterprise Cloud technology. Furthermore, we highlight the difference between High Performance Computing (HPC) workload and Internet-based services workload. We also describe a meta-negotiation infrastructure to establish global Cloud exchanges and markets, and illustrate a case study of harnessing 'Storage Clouds' for high performance content delivery. Finally, we conclude with the need for convergence of competing IT paradigms to deliver our 21st century vision. Computing is being transformed to a model consisting of services that are commoditized and delivered in a manner similar to traditional utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and telephony. In such a model, users access services based on their requirements without regard to where the services are hosted or how they are delivered. Several computing paradigms have promised to deliver this utility computing vision and these include cluster computing, Grid computing, and more recently Cloud computing. businesses and users are able to access applications from anywhere in the world on demand. Thus, the computing world is rapidly transforming towards developing software for millions to consume as a service, rather than to run on their individual computers. At present, it is common to access content across the Internet independently without reference to the underlying hosting infrastructure. This infrastructure consists of data centers that are monitored and maintained around the clock …","","","4564","","","","","[{'authorId': '1709598', 'name': 'R.

We argue that the organization of 3D point clouds can be efficiently captured by a structure called superpoint graph (SPG), derived from a partition of the scanned scene into geometrically homogeneous elements. SPGs offer a compact yet rich representation of contextual relationships between object parts, which is then exploited by a graph convolutional network. Our framework sets a new state of the art for segmenting outdoor LiDAR scans (+11.9 and +8.8 mIoU points for both Semantic3D test sets), as well as indoor scans (+12.4 mIoU points for the S3DIS dataset).","2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","2017.0","1195","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Conference']","2017-11-27","{'name': '2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'pages': '4558-4567'}","[{'authorId': '115987954', 'name': 'Loic Landrieu'}, {'authorId': '3451689', 'name': 'M.

Despite the recent success of deep learning models in discriminative tasks of point clouds, generating point clouds remains challenging. This paper proposes a principled probabilistic framework to generate 3D point clouds by modeling them as a distribution of distributions. Specifically, we learn a two-level hierarchy of distributions where the first level is the distribution of shapes and the second level is the distribution of points given a shape. This formulation allows us to both sample shapes and sample an arbitrary number of points from a shape. Our generative model, named PointFlow, learns each level of the distribution with a continuous normalizing flow. The invertibility of normalizing flows enables the computation of the likelihood during training and allows us to train our model in the variational inference framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that PointFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud generation. We additionally show that our model can faithfully reconstruct point clouds and learn useful representations in an unsupervised manner.

At the same time, such devices often enjoy strong connectivity with more powerful machines ranging from laptops and desktops to commercial clouds. This paper presents the design and implementation of CloneCloud, a system that automatically transforms mobile applications to benefit from the cloud. The system is a flexible application partitioner and execution runtime that enables unmodified mobile applications running in an application-level virtual machine to seamlessly off-load part of their execution from mobile devices onto device clones operating in a computational cloud. CloneCloud uses a combination of static analysis and dynamic profiling to partition applications automatically at a fine granularity while optimizing execution time and energy use for a target computation and communication environment. At runtime, the application partitioning is effected by migrating a thread from the mobile device at a chosen point to the clone in the cloud, executing there for the remainder of the partition, and re-integrating the migrated thread back to the mobile device. Our evaluation shows that CloneCloud can adapt application partitioning to different environments, and can help some applications achieve as much as a 20x execution speed-up and a 20-fold decrease of energy spent on the mobile device.","European Conference on Computer Systems","2011.0","2047","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2011-04-10","{'pages': '301-314'}","[{'authorId': '1704157', 'name': 'Byung-Gon Chun'}, {'authorId': '2937896', 'name': 'Sunghwan Ihm'}, {'authorId': '2286904', 'name': 'Petros Maniatis'}, {'authorId': '145835621', 'name': 'M.

Existing frameworks for point cloud genera-ion either do not consider structure in their proposed solutions, or assume and enforce a specific structure/topology,e.g. a collection of manifolds or surfaces, for the generated point cloud of a 3D object. In this work, we pro-pose a novel decoder that generates a structured point cloud without assuming any specific structure or topology on the underlying point set. Our decoder is softly constrained to generate a point cloud following a hierarchical rooted tree structure. We show that given enough capacity and allowing for redundancies, the proposed decoder is very flexible and able to learn any arbitrary grouping of points including any topology on the point set.

To improve edge cloud efficiency with limited communication and computation capacities, we investigate the collaboration between cloud computing and edge computing, where the tasks of mobile devices can be partially processed at the edge node and at the cloud server. First, a joint communication and computation resource allocation problem is formulated to minimize the weighted-sum latency of all mobile devices. Then, the closed-form optimal task splitting strategy is derived as a function of the normalized backhaul communication capacity and the normalized cloud computation capacity. Some interesting and useful insights for the optimal task splitting strategy are also highlighted by analyzing four special scenarios. Based on this, we further transform the original joint communication and computation resource allocation problem into an equivalent convex optimization problem and obtain the closed-form computation resource allocation strategy by leveraging the convex optimization theory. Moreover, a necessary condition is also developed to judge whether a task should be processed at the corresponding edge node only, without offloading to the cloud server. Finally, simulation results confirm our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the proposed collaborative cloud and edge computing scheme can evidently achieve a better delay performance than the conventional schemes.","IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","2019.0","450","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2019-03-11","{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology', 'pages': '5031-5044', 'volume': '68'}","[{'authorId': '10770281', 'name': 'Jinke Ren'}, {'authorId': '1703118', 'name': 'Guanding Yu'}, {'authorId': '51178155', 'name': 'Yinghui He'}, {'authorId': '1410112765', 'name': 'Geoffrey Y.

However, the dramatically increasing number of devices and data traffic in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era are posing significant burdens on the capacity-limited Internet and uncontrollable service delay. It becomes difficult to meet the delay-sensitive and context-aware service requirements of IoT applications by using cloud computing alone. Facing these challenges, computing paradigms are shifting from the centralized cloud computing to distributed edge computing. Several new computing paradigms, including Transparent Computing, Mobile Edge Computing, Fog Computing, and Cloudlet, have emerged to leverage the distributed resources at network edge to provide timely and context-aware services. By integrating end devices, edge servers, and cloud, they form a hierarchical IoT architecture, i.e., End-Edge-Cloud orchestrated architecture to improve the performance of IoT systems. This article presents a comprehensive survey of these emerging computing paradigms from the perspective of end-edge-cloud orchestration. Specifically, we first introduce and compare the architectures and characteristics of different computing paradigms. Then, a comprehensive survey is presented to discuss state-of-the-art research in terms of computation offloading, caching, security, and privacy.

In turn, the use of virtualization allows third-party cloud providers to maximize the utilization of their sunk capital costs by multiplexing many customer VMs across a shared physical infrastructure. However, in this paper, we show that this approach can also introduce new vulnerabilities. Using the Amazon EC2 service as a case study, we show that it is possible to map the internal cloud infrastructure, identify where a particular target VM is likely to reside, and then instantiate new VMs until one is placed co-resident with the target. We explore how such placement can then be used to mount cross-VM side-channel attacks to extract information from a target VM on the same machine.","Conference on Computer and Communications Security","2009.0","2368","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Conference']","2009-11-09","{'pages': '199-212'}","[{'authorId': '1707461', 'name': 'Thomas Ristenpart'}, {'authorId': '2337345', 'name': 'Eran Tromer'}, {'authorId': '1786752', 'name': 'H.

We describe our labelling interface and show that our data set provides more dense and complete point clouds with much higher overall number of labelled points compared to those already available to the research community. We further provide baseline method descriptions and comparison between methods submitted to our online system.

The algorithm decomposes the point cloud into a concise, hybrid structure of inherent shapes and a set of remaining points. Each detected shape serves as a proxy for a set of corresponding points. Our method is based on random sampling and detects planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori. For models with surfaces composed of these basic shapes only, for example, CAD models, we automatically obtain a representation solely consisting of shape proxies. We demonstrate that the algorithm is robust even in the presence of many outliers and a high degree of noise. The proposed method scales well with respect to the size of the input point cloud and the number and size of the shapes within the data. Even point sets with several millions of samples are robustly decomposed within less than a minute. Moreover, the algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Application areas include measurement of physical parameters, scan registration, surface compression, hybrid rendering, shape classification, meshing, simplification, approximation and reverse engineering.","Computer graphics forum (Print)","2007.0","2036","['Mathematics', 'Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2007-06-01","{'name': 'Computer Graphics Forum', 'volume': '26'}","[{'authorId': '39596695', 'name': 'Ruwen Schnabel'}, {'authorId': '20824819', 'name': 'Roland Wahl'}, {'authorId': '1698206', 'name': 'R.

While being able to accommodate inference of a deep neural network (DNN) in the cloud, a DDNN also allows fast and localized inference using shallow portions of the neural network at the edge and end devices. When supported by a scalable distributed computing hierarchy, a DDNN can scale up in neural network size and scale out in geographical span. Due to its distributed nature, DDNNs enhance sensor fusion, system fault tolerance and data privacy for DNN applications. In implementing a DDNN, we map sections of a DNN onto a distributed computing hierarchy. By jointly training these sections, we minimize communication and resource usage for devices and maximize usefulness of extracted features which are utilized in the cloud. The resulting system has built-in support for automatic sensor fusion and fault tolerance. As a proof of concept, we show a DDNN can exploit geographical diversity of sensors to improve object recognition accuracy and reduce communication cost. In our experiment, compared with the traditional method of offloading raw sensor data to be processed in the cloud, DDNN locally processes most sensor data on end devices while achieving high accuracy and is able to reduce the communication cost by a factor of over 20x.","IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","2017.0","695","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Conference']","2017-06-05","{'name': '2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)', 'pages': '328-339'}","[{'authorId': '3242151', 'name': 'Surat Teerapittayanon'}, {'authorId': '1841852', 'name': 'Bradley McDanel'}, {'authorId': '144153718', 'name': 'H.

Collection 6 (C6) reprocessing of the product was completed in May 2014 and March 2015 for MODIS Aqua and Terra, respectively. Here we provide an overview of major C6 optical property algorithm changes relative to the previous Collection 5 (C5) product. Notable C6 optical and microphysical algorithm changes include: 1) new ice cloud optical property models and a more extensive cloud radiative transfer code lookup table (LUT) approach; 2) improvement in the skill of the shortwave-derived cloud thermodynamic phase; 3) separate cloud effective radius retrieval data sets for each spectral combination used in previous collections; 4) separate retrievals for partly cloudy pixels and those associated with cloud edges; 5) failure metrics that provide diagnostic information for pixels having observations that fall outside the LUT solution space; and 6) enhanced pixel-level retrieval uncertainty calculations. The C6 algorithm changes can collectively result in significant changes relative to C5, though the magnitude depends on the data set and the pixel's retrieval location in the cloud parameter space. Example L2 granule and level-3 gridded data set differences between the two collections are shown.

A unique problem introduced during the process of public auditing for shared data in the cloud is how to preserve identity privacy from the TPA, because the identities of signers on shared data may indicate that a particular user in the group or a special block in shared data is a higher valuable target than others. Abstract—With cloud storage services, it is common place for data to be not only stored in the cloud, but also shared across multiple users. However, public auditing for such shared data — while preserving identity privacy— remains to be an open challenge. In this paper, we propose the first privacy-preserving mechanism that allows public auditing on shared data stored in the cloud. In particular, we exploit ring signatures to compute the verification information needed to audit the integrity of shared data. With our mechanism, the identity of the signer on each block in shared data is kept private from a third party auditor (TPA), who is still able to publicly verify the integrity of shared data without retrieving the entire file.

In this paper we propose a new cloud architecture that uses reconfigurable logic to accelerate both network plane functions and applications. This Configurable Cloud architecture places a layer of reconfigurable logic (FPGAs) between the network switches and the servers, enabling network flows to be programmably transformed at line rate, enabling acceleration of local applications running on the server, and enabling the FPGAs to communicate directly, at datacenter scale, to harvest remote FPGAs unused by their local servers. We deployed this design over a production server bed, and show how it can be used for both service acceleration (Web search ranking) and network acceleration (encryption of data in transit at high-speeds). This architecture is much more scalable than prior work which used secondary rack-scale networks for inter-FPGA communication. By coupling to the network plane, direct FPGA-to-FPGA messages can be achieved at comparable latency to previous work, without the secondary network. Additionally, the scale of direct inter-FPGA messaging is much larger. The average round-trip latencies observed in our measurements among 24, 1000, and 250,000 machines are under 3, 9, and 20 microseconds, respectively. The Configurable Cloud architecture has been deployed at hyperscale in Microsoft's production datacenters worldwide.","Micro","2016.0","565","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2016-10-15","{'name': '2016 49th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO)', 'pages': '1-13'}","[{'authorId': '2986818', 'name': 'Adrian M.

To always retrieve the localized data from the remote cloud, however, tends to be inefficient, which motivates fog computing. The fog computing, also known as edge computing, extends cloud computing by deploying localized computing facilities at the premise of users, which prestores cloud data and distributes to mobile users with fast-rate local connections. As such, fog computing introduces an intermediate fog layer between mobile users and cloud, and complements cloud computing toward low-latency high-rate services to mobile users. In this fundamental framework, it is important to study the interplay and cooperation between the edge (fog) and the core (cloud). In this paper, the tradeoff between power consumption and transmission delay in the fog-cloud computing system is investigated. We formulate a workload allocation problem which suggests the optimal workload allocations between fog and cloud toward the minimal power consumption with the constrained service delay. The problem is then tackled using an approximate approach by decomposing the primal problem into three subproblems of corresponding subsystems, which can be, respectively, solved. Finally, based on simulations and numerical results, we show that by sacrificing modest computation resources to save communication bandwidth and reduce transmission latency, fog computing can significantly improve the performance of cloud computing.","IEEE Internet of Things Journal","2016.0","687","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2016-05-10","{'name': 'IEEE Internet of Things Journal', 'pages': '1171-1181', 'volume': '3'}","[{'authorId': '9351870', 'name': 'Ruilong Deng'}, {'authorId': '144988716', 'name': 'R.

Specifically, in the first stage, the approach predicts a complete but coarse-grained point cloud with a collection of parametric surface elements. Then, in the second stage, it merges the coarse-grained prediction with the input point cloud by a novel sampling algorithm. Our method utilizes a joint loss function to guide the distribution of the points.

As promising as it is, this paradigm also brings forth many new challenges for data security and access control when users outsource sensitive data for sharing on cloud servers, which are not within the same trusted domain as data owners. To keep sensitive user data confidential against untrusted servers, existing solutions usually apply cryptographic methods by disclosing data decryption keys only to authorized users. However, in doing so, these solutions inevitably introduce a heavy computation overhead on the data owner for key distribution and data management when fine-grained data access control is desired, and thus do not scale well. The problem of simultaneously achieving fine-grainedness, scalability, and data confidentiality of access control actually still remains unresolved. This paper addresses this challenging open issue by, on one hand, defining and enforcing access policies based on data attributes, and, on the other hand, allowing the data owner to delegate most of the computation tasks involved in fine-grained data access control to untrusted cloud servers without disclosing the underlying data contents. We achieve this goal by exploiting and uniquely combining techniques of attribute-based encryption (ABE), proxy re-encryption, and lazy re-encryption. Our proposed scheme also has salient properties of user access privilege confidentiality and user secret key accountability. Extensive analysis shows that our proposed scheme is highly efficient and provably secure under existing security models.","2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","2010.0","2103","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2010-03-14","{'name': '2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM', 'pages': '1-9'}","[{'authorId': '34744447', 'name': 'Shucheng Yu'}, {'authorId': None, 'name': 'Cong Wang'}, {'authorId': '144222395', 'name': 'K.

The size distributions include sufficient very small carbonaceous grains (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules) to account for the observed infrared and microwave emission from the diffuse interstellar medium. Our distributions reproduce the observed extinction of starlight, which varies depending on the interstellar environment through which the light travels. As shown by Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis in 1989, these variations can be roughly parameterized by the ratio of visual extinction to reddening, RV. We adopt a fairly simple functional form for the size distribution, characterized by several parameters. We tabulate these parameters for various combinations of values for RV and bC, the C abundance in very small grains. We also find size distributions for the line of sight to HD 210121 and for sight lines in the LMC and SMC. For several size distributions, we evaluate the albedo and scattering asymmetry parameter and present model extinction curves extending beyond the Lyman limit.","","2001.0","1743","['Physics']","","2001-02-10","{'name': 'The Astrophysical Journal', 'pages': '296 - 309', 'volume': '548'}","[{'authorId': '101113879', 'name': 'J.

While distributed computation frameworks have moved beyond a simple map-reduce model, many users are still left to struggle with complex cluster management and configuration tools, even for running simple embarrassingly parallel jobs. We argue that stateless functions represent a viable platform for these users, eliminating cluster management overhead, fulfilling the promise of elasticity. Furthermore, using our prototype implementation, PyWren, we show that this model is general enough to implement a number of distributed computing models, such as BSP, efficiently. Extrapolating from recent trends in network bandwidth and the advent of disaggregated storage, we suggest that stateless functions are a natural fit for data processing in future computing environments.","ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing","2017.0","499","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Book']","2017-02-13","{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2017 Symposium on Cloud Computing'}","[{'authorId': '145426489', 'name': 'Eric Jonas'}, {'authorId': '2699039', 'name': 'Qifan Pu'}, {'authorId': '2697906', 'name': 'S.

With recent advances in software-defined networking (SDN), SDN-based cloud brings us new chances to defeat DDoS attacks in cloud computing environments. Nevertheless, there is a contradictory relationship between SDN and DDoS attacks. On one hand, the capabilities of SDN, including software-based traffic analysis, centralized control, global view of the network, dynamic updating of forwarding rules, make it easier to detect and react to DDoS attacks. On the other hand, the security of SDN itself remains to be addressed, and potential DDoS vulnerabilities exist across SDN platforms. In this paper, we discuss the new trends and characteristics of DDoS attacks in cloud computing, and provide a comprehensive survey of defense mechanisms against DDoS attacks using SDN. In addition, we review the studies about launching DDoS attacks on SDN, as well as the methods against DDoS attacks in SDN. To the best of our knowledge, the contradictory relationship between SDN and DDoS attacks has not been well addressed in previous works. This work can help to understand how to make full use of SDN's advantages to defeat DDoS attacks in cloud computing environments and how to prevent SDN itself from becoming a victim of DDoS attacks, which are important for the smooth evolution of SDN-based cloud without the distraction of DDoS attacks.","IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials","2016.0","707","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2016-01-21","{'name': 'IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials', 'pages': '602-622', 'volume': '18'}","[{'authorId': '144523271', 'name': 'Qiao Yan'}, {'authorId': '29953431', 'name': 'F.

General circulation models (GCMs) are the tool for predicting future climate, but the treatment of aerosols, clouds, and aerosol−cloud radiative effects carries large uncertainties that directly affect GCM predictions, such as climate sensitivity. Predictions are hampered by the large range of scales of interaction between various components that need to be captured. Observation systems (remote sensing, in situ) are increasingly being used to constrain predictions, but significant challenges exist, to some extent because of the large range of scales and the fact that the various measuring systems tend to address different scales. Fine-scale models represent clouds, aerosols, and aerosol−cloud interactions with high fidelity but do not include interactions with the larger scale and are therefore limited from a climatic point of view. We suggest strategies for improving estimates of aerosol−cloud relationships in climate models, for new remote sensing and in situ measurements, and for quantifying and reducing model uncertainty.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","2016.0","603","['Medicine', 'Geography']","","2016-05-24","{'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences', 'pages': '5781 - 5790', 'volume': '113'}","[{'authorId': '2530017', 'name': 'J.

Often, the management of clusters of containers becomes essential and the orchestration of the construction and deployment becomes a central problem. This emerging topic has been taken up by researchers, but there is currently no secondary study to consolidate this research. We aim to identify, taxonomically classify and systematically compare the existing research body on containers and their orchestration and specifically the application of this technology in the cloud. We have conducted a systematic mapping study of 46 selected studies. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterisation framework. This results in a discussion of agreed and emerging concerns in the container orchestration space, positioning it within the cloud context, but also moving it closer to current concerns in cloud platforms, microservices and continuous development.","IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","2019.0","313","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Review']","2019-07-01","{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing', 'pages': '677-692', 'volume': '7'}","[{'authorId': '8516149', 'name': 'C.

This article surveys e application layer communication protocols to fulfill the IoT communication requirements, and their potential for implementation in fog- and cloud-based IoT systems. To this end, the article first briefly presents potential protocol candidates, including request-reply and publish-subscribe protocols. After that, the article surveys these protocols based on their main characteristics, as well as the main performance issues, including latency, energy consumption, and network throughput. These findings are thereafter used to place the protocols in each segment of the system (IoT, fog, cloud), and thus opens up the discussion on their choice, interoperability, and wider system integration.

It has attracted attention in various applications such as 3D tele-presence, navigation for unmanned vehicles and heritage reconstruction. The understanding of point clouds, such as point cloud segmentation, is crucial in exploiting the informative value of point clouds for such applications. Due to the irregularity of the data format, previous deep learning works often convert point clouds to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images before feeding them into neural networks, which leads to voluminous data and quantization artifacts. In this paper, we instead propose a regularized graph convolutional neural network (RGCNN) that directly consumes point clouds. Leveraging on spectral graph theory, we treat features of points in a point cloud as signals on graph, and define the convolution over graph by Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In particular, we update the graph Laplacian matrix that describes the connectivity of features in each layer according to the corresponding learned features, which adaptively captures the structure of dynamic graphs. Further, we deploy a graph-signal smoothness prior in the loss function, thus regularizing the learning process. Experimental results on the ShapeNet part dataset show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the computational complexity while achieving competitive performance with the state of the art. Also, experiments show RGCNN is much more robust to both noise and point cloud density in comparison with other methods. We further apply RGCNN to point cloud classification and achieve competitive results on ModelNet40 dataset.","ACM Multimedia","2018.0","313","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Book']","2018-06-08","{'name': 'Proceedings of the 26th ACM international conference on Multimedia'}","[{'authorId': '93104384', 'name': 'Gusi Te'}, {'authorId': '1486300471', 'name': 'Wei Hu'}, {'authorId': '35310979', 'name': 'Zongming Guo'}, {'authorId': '2060163708', 'name': 'Amin Zheng'}]"

After achieving final orbit, MODIS began Earth observations in late February 2000 and has been acquiring data since that time. The instrument is also being flown on the Aqua spacecraft, launched in May 2002. A comprehensive set of remote sensing algorithms for cloud detection and the retrieval of cloud physical and optical properties have been developed by members of the MODIS atmosphere science team. The archived products from these algorithms have applications in climate change studies, climate modeling, numerical weather prediction, as well as fundamental atmospheric research. In addition to an extensive cloud mask, products include cloud-top properties (temperature, pressure, effective emissivity), cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud optical and microphysical parameters (optical thickness, effective particle radius, water path), as well as derived statistics. We will describe the various algorithms being used for the remote sensing of cloud properties from MODIS data with an emphasis on the pixel-level retrievals (referred to as Level-2 products), with 1-km or 5-km spatial resolution at nadir. An example of each Level-2 cloud product from a common data granule (5 min of data) off the coast of South America will be discussed. Future efforts will also be mentioned. Relevant points related to the global gridded statistics products (Level-3) are highlighted though additional details are given in an accompanying paper in this issue.","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","2003.0","1741","['Environmental Science', 'Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2003-04-29","{'name': 'IEEE Trans.

By data outsourcing, users can be relieved from the burden of local data storage and maintenance. However, the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the possibly large size of outsourced data makes the data integrity protection in Cloud Computing a very challenging and potentially formidable task, especially for users with constrained computing resources and capabilities. Thus, enabling public auditability for cloud data storage security is of critical importance so that users can resort to an external audit party to check the integrity of outsourced data when needed. To securely introduce an effective third party auditor (TPA), the following two fundamental requirements have to be met: 1) TPA should be able to efficiently audit the cloud data storage without demanding the local copy of data, and introduce no additional on-line burden to the cloud user; 2) The third party auditing process should bring in no new vulnerabilities towards user data privacy. In this paper, we utilize and uniquely combine the public key based homomorphic authenticator with random masking to achieve the privacy-preserving public cloud data auditing system, which meets all above requirements. To support efficient handling of multiple auditing tasks, we further explore the technique of bilinear aggregate signature to extend our main result into a multi-user setting, where TPA can perform multiple auditing tasks simultaneously. Extensive security and performance analysis shows the proposed schemes are provably secure and highly efficient.","2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","2010.0","1858","['Computer Science', 'Business']","['JournalArticle']","2010-03-14","{'name': '2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM', 'pages': '1-9'}","[{'authorId': None, 'name': 'Cong Wang'}, {'authorId': '40102806', 'name': 'Qian Wang'}, {'authorId': '144222395', 'name': 'K.

Although tremendous progress has been made to improve the understanding of basic physical mechanisms of aerosol–cloud interactions and reduce their uncertainties in climate forcing, there is still poor understanding of 1) some of the mechanisms that interact with each other over multiple spatial and temporal scales, 2) the feedbacks between microphysical and dynamical processes and between local-scale processes and large-scale circulations, and 3) the significance of cloud–aerosol interactions on weather systems as well as regional and global climate.

Accordingly, we first examine the costs of cloud service data centers today. The cost breakdown reveals the importance of optimizing work completed per dollar invested. Unfortunately, the resources inside the data centers often operate at low utilization due to resource stranding and fragmentation. To attack this first problem, we propose (1) increasing network agility, and (2) providing appropriate incentives to shape resource consumption. Second, we note that cloud service providers are building out geo-distributed networks of data centers. Geo-diversity lowers latency to users and increases reliability in the presence of an outage taking out an entire site. However, without appropriate design and management, these geo-diverse data center networks can raise the cost of providing service. Moreover, leveraging geo-diversity requires services be designed to benefit from it. To attack this problem, we propose (1) joint optimization of network and data center resources, and (2) new systems and mechanisms for geo-distributing state.","CCRV","2008.0","1860","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2008-12-31","{'name': 'Comput.

Users can be relieved of the burden of storage and computation, by outsourcing the large data files to the cloud servers. However, from the cloud service providers' point of view, it is wise to utilize the data deduplication techniques to reduce the costs of running large storage system and energy consumption on cloud servers. Based on the dynamic nature of data in the cloud storage system, we not only need to assure the data integrity with an auditing protocol supporting dynamic data operations for users, but also consider resorting to data deduplication techniques in the dynamic data operations for cloud service providers to achieve the goal of reducing costs. Thus, in this paper, we propose a mechanism that combines data deduplication with dynamic data operations in the privacy preserving public auditing for secure cloud storage. The analysis of security and performance shows that the proposed mechanism is highly efficient and provably secure.","22017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC)","2017.0","380","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Conference']","2017-07-21","{'name': '22017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC)', 'pages': '562-567', 'volume': '01'}","[{'authorId': None, 'name': 'Cong Wang'}, {'authorId': '145876490', 'name': 'Sherman S.

Conventionally, the errors between point clouds are measured in terms of point-to-point or point-to-surface distances, that either ignores the surface structures or heavily tends to rely on specific surface reconstructions. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose using point-to-plane distances as a measure of geometric distortions on point cloud compression. The intrinsic resolution of the point clouds is proposed as a normalizer to convert the mean square errors to PSNR numbers. In addition, the perceived local planes are investigated at different scales of the point cloud. Finally, the proposed metric is independent of the size of the point cloud and rather reveals the geometric fidelity of the point cloud. From experiments, we demonstrate that our method could better track the perceived quality than the point-to-point approach while requires limited computations.","International Conference on Information Photonics","2017.0","321","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Conference']","2017-09-01","{'name': '2017 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)', 'pages': '3460-3464'}","[{'authorId': '144309297', 'name': 'Dong Tian'}, {'authorId': '9169832', 'name': 'H.

In this paper, to efficiently handle the peak load and satisfy the requirements of remote program execution, we propose to deploy cloud servers at the network edge and design the edge cloud as a tree hierarchy of geo-distributed servers, so as to efficiently utilize the cloud resources to serve the peak loads from mobile users. The hierarchical architecture of edge cloud enables aggregation of the peak loads across different tiers of cloud servers to maximize the amount of mobile workloads being served. To ensure efficient utilization of cloud resources, we further propose a workload placement algorithm that decides which edge cloud servers mobile programs are placed on and how much computational capacity is provisioned to execute each program. The performance of our proposed hierarchical edge cloud architecture on serving mobile workloads is evaluated by formal analysis, small-scale system experimentation, and large-scale trace-based simulations.","IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications","2016.0","452","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Conference']","2016-04-10","{'name': 'IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications', 'pages': '1-9'}","[{'authorId': '2069441004', 'name': 'Liang Tong'}, {'authorId': '2154405247', 'name': 'Yong Li'}, {'authorId': '145816343', 'name': 'Wei Gao'}]"

Workflow scheduling is one of the most challenging problems in cloud computing. Although, workflow scheduling on distributed systems like grids and clusters have been extensively studied, however, these solutions are not viable for a cloud environment. It is because, a cloud environment differs from other distributed environment in two major ways: on-demand resource provisioning and pay-as-you-go pricing model. Thus, to achieve the true benefits of workflow orchestration onto cloud resources novel approaches that can capitalize the advantages and address the challenges specific to a cloud environment needs to be developed. This work proposes a dynamic cost-effective deadline-constrained heuristic algorithm for scheduling a scientific workflow in a public cloud. The proposed technique aims to exploit the advantages offered by cloud computing while taking into account the virtual machine (VM) performance variability and instance acquisition delay to identify a just-in-time schedule of a deadline constrained scientific workflow at lesser costs. Performance evaluation on some well-known scientific workflows exhibit that the proposed algorithm delivers better performance in comparison to the current state-of-the-art heuristics.","IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","2018.0","194","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","","{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing', 'pages': '2-18', 'volume': '6'}","[{'authorId': '48938947', 'name': 'Jyoti Sahni'}, {'authorId': '3211750', 'name': 'D.

Despite the potential gains achieved from the cloud computing, the model security is still questionable which impacts the cloud model adoption. The security problem becomes more complicated under the cloud model as new dimensions have entered into the problem scope related to the model architecture, multi-tenancy, elasticity, and layers dependency stack. In this paper we introduce a detailed analysis of the cloud security problem. We investigated the problem from the cloud architecture perspective, the cloud offered characteristics perspective, the cloud stakeholders' perspective, and the cloud service delivery models perspective. Based on this analysis we derive a detailed specification of the cloud security problem and key features that should be covered by any proposed security solution.","Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference","2016.0","439","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle']","2016-09-05","{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume': 'abs/1609.01107'}","[{'authorId': '3166473', 'name': 'Mohamed Almorsy'}, {'authorId': '1687239', 'name': 'J.

Cloud Computing has emerged as a popular computing model to support processing large volumetric data using clusters of commodity computers. According to J.Dean and S. Ghemawat [1], Google currently processes over 20 terabytes of raw web data. It's some fascinating, large-scale processing of data that makes your head spin and appreciate the years of distributed computing fine-tuning applied to today's large problems. The evolution of cloud computing can handle such massive data as per on demand service. Nowadays the computational world is opting for pay-for-use models and Hype and discussion aside, there remains no concrete definition of cloud computing. In this paper, we first develop a comprehensive taxonomy for describing cloud computing architecture. Then we use this taxonomy to survey several existing cloud computing services developed by various projects world-wide such as Google, force.com, Amazon. We use the taxonomy and survey results not only to identify similarities and differences of the architectural approaches of cloud computing, but also to identify areas requiring further research.","2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC","2009.0","1541","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Conference', 'Review']","2009-08-25","{'name': '2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC', 'pages': '44-51'}","[{'authorId': '3407759', 'name': 'B.

Cloud users rely on both the provider’s staff and its globally distributed software/hardware platform not to expose any of their private data. We introduce the notion of shielded execution, which protects the confidentiality and integrity of a program and its data from the platform on which it runs (i.e., the cloud operator’s OS, VM, and firmware). Our prototype, Haven, is the first system to achieve shielded execution of unmodified legacy applications, including SQL Server and Apache, on a commodity OS (Windows) and commodity hardware. Haven leverages the hardware protection of Intel SGX to defend against privileged code and physical attacks such as memory probes, and also addresses the dual challenges of executing unmodified legacy binaries and protecting them from a malicious host. This work motivated recent changes in the SGX specification.","USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation","2014.0","805","['Computer Science']","['JournalArticle', 'Conference']","2014-10-06","{'name': 'ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS)', 'pages': '1 - 26', 'volume': '33'}","[{'authorId': '1919355', 'name': 'Andrew Baumann'}, {'authorId': '143697538', 'name': 'Marcus Peinado'}, {'authorId': '1880051', 'name': 'G.
