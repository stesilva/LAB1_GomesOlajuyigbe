Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications. In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems;['144404817'];['J.

In a preregistered online experiment, we assigned occupation-specific, incentivized writing tasks to 453 college-educated professionals and randomly exposed half of them to ChatGPT. Our results show that ChatGPT substantially raised productivity: The average time taken decreased by 40% and output quality rose by 18%. Inequality between workers decreased, and concern and excitement about AI temporarily rose. Workers exposed to ChatGPT during the experiment were 2 times as likely to report using it in their real job 2 weeks after the experiment and 1.6 times as likely 2 months after the experiment. Description Editor’s summary Automation has historically displaced human workers in factories (e.g., automotive manufacturing) or in performing routine computational tasks.

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting.

7ac3e09d74ca15fdafa5f730617cd65059a144f3;Weakly Supervised Anomaly Detection: A Survey;Anomaly detection (AD) is a crucial task in machine learning with various applications, such as detecting emerging diseases, identifying financial frauds, and detecting fake news. However, obtaining complete, accurate, and precise labels for AD tasks can be expensive and challenging due to the cost and difficulties in data annotation. To address this issue, researchers have developed AD methods that can work with incomplete, inexact, and inaccurate supervision, collectively summarized as weakly supervised anomaly detection (WSAD) methods. In this study, we present the first comprehensive survey of WSAD methods by categorizing them into the above three weak supervision settings across four data modalities (i.e., tabular, graph, time-series, and image/video data). For each setting, we provide formal definitions, key algorithms, and potential future directions. To support future research, we conduct experiments on a selected setting and release the source code, along with a collection of WSAD methods and data.;['2152154941', '2204929921', '2204948431', '35346885', '2004577591', '2146285145', '7792071', '152297693', '145454815'];['Minqi Jiang', 'Chaochuan Hou', 'Ao Zheng', 'Xiyang Hu', 'Songqiao Han', 'Hailiang Huang', 'Xiangnan He', 'Philip S.

25ca87d83b99831af6c75c4f962e63c18f2cd298;Explaining Explanations: An Approach to Evaluating Interpretability of Machine Learning;—There has recently been a surge of work in explanatory artiﬁcial intelligence (XAI). This research area tackles the important problem that complex machines and algorithms often cannot provide insights into their behavior and thought processes. XAI allows users and parts of the internal system to be more transparent, providing explanations of their decisions in some level of detail. These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we provide our deﬁnition of explainability and show how it can be used to classify existing literature. We discuss why current approaches to explanatory methods especially for deep neural networks are insufﬁcient.

Counterfactual theories of causal judgments predict that people compare what actually happened with what would have happened if the candidate cause had been absent. Process theories predict that people focus only on what actually happened, to assess the mechanism linking candidate cause and outcome. We tracked participants’ eye movements while they judged whether one billiard ball caused another one to go through a gate or prevented it from going through. Both participants’ looking patterns and their judgments demonstrated that counterfactual simulation played a critical role. Participants simulated where the target ball would have gone if the candidate cause had been removed from the scene. The more certain participants were that the outcome would have been different, the stronger the causal judgments. These results provide the first direct evidence for spontaneous counterfactual simulation in an important domain;['2697953', '2058930057', '144002017', '1953585', '1763295'];['Tobias Gerstenberg', 'Matthew Peterson', 'Noah D.

4c4140cd59969f65f6bfc4a8632a8bfae7889097;CoRTX: Contrastive Framework for Real-time Explanation;Recent advancements in explainable machine learning provide effective and faithful solutions for interpreting model behaviors. However, many explanation methods encounter efficiency issues, which largely limit their deployments in practical scenarios. Real-time explainer (RTX) frameworks have thus been proposed to accelerate the model explanation process by learning a one-feed-forward explainer. Existing RTX frameworks typically build the explainer under the supervised learning paradigm, which requires large amounts of explanation labels as the ground truth. Considering that accurate explanation labels are usually hard to obtain due to constrained computational resources and limited human efforts, effective explainer training is still challenging in practice. In this work, we propose a COntrastive Real-Time eXplanation (CoRTX) framework to learn the explanation-oriented representation and relieve the intensive dependence of explainer training on explanation labels. Specifically, we design a synthetic strategy to select positive and negative instances for the learning of explanation. Theoretical analysis show that our selection strategy;['27615982', '32780441', '47829900', '2116289774', '2351824', '2145065759', '2193021044'];['Yu-Neng Chuang', 'Guanchu Wang', 'Fan Yang', 'Quan Zhou', 'Pushkar Tripathi', 'Xuanting Cai', 'Xia Hu'];939c6e1d-0d17-4d6e-8a82-66d960df0e40;International Conference on Learning Representations;conference;10;2023.0;Chicago;;;;;['Computer Science'];['ce81a788d41bc8c4219db99556bee813f60d14d0', 'b227f3e4c0dc96e5ac5426b85485a70f2175a205']

8df72c48a7ce4418c683c4dd9bb300558ac71d47;Deep learning for healthcare: review, opportunities and challenges;Gaining knowledge and actionable insights from complex, high-dimensional and heterogeneous biomedical data remains a key challenge in transforming health care. Various types of data have been emerging in modern biomedical research, including electronic health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which are complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated and generally unstructured. Traditional data mining and statistical learning approaches typically need to first perform feature engineering to obtain effective and more robust features from those data, and then build prediction or clustering models on top of them. There are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated data and lacking of sufficient domain knowledge. The latest advances in deep learning technologies provide new effective paradigms to obtain end-to-end learning models from complex data. In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning technologies to advance the health care domain.

The chemical reaction codes or χDLs for the reactions have been stored in a database for version control, validation, collaboration, and data mining. Of these syntheses, more than 50 entries from the database have been downloaded and robotically run in seven modular ChemPU’s with yields and purities comparable to those achieved by an expert chemist.

It is remarkable how artificial intelligence can mimic human behavior and writing style in such a convincing way. As a result, it is hard to tell if a human or a machine wrote something. Deep learning and natural language processing have recently advanced large language models. These newer models can learn from large amounts of data to better capture the nuances of language, making them more accurate and robust than ever before. Additionally, these models can now be applied to tasks such as summarizing text, translating between languages, and even generating original content.

With regard to radiographic phenotypes, generally unconnected through present understanding to the presence of specific mutations, artificial intelligence methods can automatically quantify phenotypic characters by using predefined, engineered algorithms or automatic deep-learning methods, a process also known as radiomics. Here we demonstrate how imaging phenotypes can be connected to somatic mutations through an integrated analysis of independent datasets of 763 lung adenocarcinoma patients with somatic mutation testing and engineered CT image analytics. We developed radiomic signatures capable of distinguishing between tumor genotypes in a discovery cohort (n = 353) and verified them in an independent validation cohort (n = 352). All radiomic signatures significantly outperformed conventional radiographic predictors (tumor volume and maximum diameter). We found a radiomic signature related to radiographic heterogeneity that successfully discriminated between EGFR+ and EGFR- cases (AUC = 0.69).

6e6c03c3a971ca0d17f21bd094beaca51b514676;Identifying Ethical Considerations for Machine Learning Healthcare Applications;Abstract Along with potential benefits to healthcare delivery, machine learning healthcare applications (ML-HCAs) raise a number of ethical concerns. Ethical evaluations of ML-HCAs will need to structure the overall problem of evaluating these technologies, especially for a diverse group of stakeholders. This paper outlines a systematic approach to identifying ML-HCA ethical concerns, starting with a conceptual model of the pipeline of the conception, development, implementation of ML-HCAs, and the parallel pipeline of evaluation and oversight tasks at each stage. Over this model, we layer key questions that raise value-based issues, along with ethical considerations identified in large part by a literature review, but also identifying some ethical considerations that have yet to receive attention. This pipeline model framework will be useful for systematic ethical appraisals of ML-HCA from development through implementation, and for interdisciplinary collaboration of diverse stakeholders that will be required to understand and subsequently manage the ethical implications;['16015502', '143650563', '5993799'];['Danton Char', 'M.

Partly this is to support integrated working styles, in which humans and intelligent systems cooperate in problem-solving, but also it is a necessary step in the process of building trust as humans migrate greater responsibility to such systems. The challenge is to find effective ways to communicate the foundations of AI-driven behaviour, when the algorithms that drive it are far from transparent to humans. In this paper we consider the opportunities that arise in AI planning, exploiting the modelbased representations that form a familiar and common basis for communication with users, while acknowledging the gap between planning algorithms and human problem-solving.;['145130479', '144954846', '1738142'];['M.

Serious Games (SGs) are a tool with an immensely positive impact and great success. SGs enable learning and provide entertainment and self-empowerment, which motivates students. The development of an SG consists of complex processes requiring multi-disciplinary knowledge in multiple domains, including knowing the learning domain and adding the appropriate game mechanics to foster high intrinsic motivation and positive player experience that makes the players feel like they are having fun while learning. Otherwise, the game is viewed as boring and not as a fun and engaging activity. Nevertheless, despite their potential, the application of SGs in education has been limited in terms of pedagogy. Several authors assert that this lack is because SG standards and guidelines have not been developed. There is an imbalance between experts’ contributions to education and game design specialists for the SG;['2044651102', '35597045', '1410071097', '117066068', '103828032'];['Mayra Carrión-Toro', 'Marco Santórum', 'Patricia Acosta-Vargas', 'José Aguilar', 'María Pérez'];;;;;;;q7l2j30y;Applied Sciences;2020.0;87;['Computer Science'];[]

As a result, programmers design software for themselves, rather than for their target audience, a phenomenon he refers to as the `inmates running the asylum'. This paper argues that explainable AI risks a similar fate. While the re-emergence of explainable AI is positive, this paper argues most of us as AI researchers are building explanatory agents for ourselves, rather than for the intended users.

Despite the proliferation of these ""AI principles,"" there has been little scholarly focus on understanding these efforts either individually or as contextualized within an expanding universe of principles with discernible trends. To that end, this white paper and its associated data visualization compare the contents of thirty-six prominent AI principles documents side-by-side. This effort uncovered a growing consensus around eight key thematic trends: privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values. Underlying this “normative core,” our analysis examined the forty-seven individual principles that make up the themes, detailing notable similarities and differences in interpretation found across the documents. In sharing these observations, it is our hope that policymakers,";['1581806280', '2092075635', '123760856', '2064047200', '2049095005'];['Jessica Fjeld', 'Nele Achten', 'Hannah Hilligoss', 'Ádám Nagy', 'Madhulika Srikumar'];;;;;;;xw7c8g0s;SSRN Electronic Journal;2020.0;51;['Sociology', 'Artificial Intelligence'];[]

983d3fec5c35c6f40f65bf971558be1d36d2bfd7;Applicability of Internet of Things in Smart Farming;Agriculture is critical to human life. Agriculture provides a means of subsistence for a sizable portion of the world’s population. Additionally, it provides a large number of work opportunities for inhabitants. Many farmers prefer traditional farming approaches, which result in low yields. Agriculture and related industries are vital to the economy’s long-term growth and development. The primary issues in agricultural production include decision-making, crop selection, and supporting systems for crop yield enhancement. Agriculture forecasting is influenced by natural variables such as temperature, soil fertility, water volume, water quality, season, and crop prices. Growing advancements in agricultural automation have resulted in a flood of tools and apps for rapid knowledge acquisition. Mobile devices are rapidly being used by everyone, including farmers. This paper presents a framework for smart crop tracking and monitoring. Sensors, Internet of Things cameras, mobile applications, and big data analytics are all covered.

A networked kissing device is proposed to sense the lip pressure of users and to produce accurate force feedback to simulate kissing sensations. The system is designed to engage multiple sensory modalities during user interaction, including touch, smell, video and voice.

We build a simple framework to formalize correspondence bias, and test its predictions in an online experiment. Consistent with correspondence bias, subjects are, on average, willing to pay to receive the dictator-game givings of an individual with whom they are randomly assigned to play a game that encourages cooperation rather than one with whom they play a game that encourages selfish behavior. We show, further, that experiencing both games oneself, as opposed to playing one and observing the other, reduces the bias, and receiving information about how each of the players behaved in both games, eliminates it.;['115141360', '1998158001', '3070352'];['Yi-Hsing Han', 'Yiming Liu', 'G.

46e7a7e8adb610f76bd0bc196282b92c846fe939;REIN: A Comprehensive Benchmark Framework for Data Cleaning Methods in ML Pipelines;Nowadays, machine learning (ML) plays a vital role in many aspects of our daily life. In essence, building well-performing ML applications requires the provision of high-quality data throughout the entire life-cycle of such applications. Nevertheless, most of the real-world tabular data suffer from different types of discrepancies, such as missing values, outliers, duplicates, pattern violation, and inconsistencies. Such discrepancies typically emerge while collecting, transferring, storing, and/or integrating the data. To deal with these discrepancies, numerous data cleaning methods have been introduced. However, the majority of such methods broadly overlook the requirements imposed by downstream ML models. As a result, the potential of utilizing these data cleaning methods in ML pipelines is predominantly unrevealed. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark, called REIN1, to thoroughly investigate the impact of data cleaning methods on various ML models. Through the benchmark, we provide answers to important research questions, e.g., where and whether;['34086911', '2174733915', '2071704751'];['Mohamed Abdelaal', 'Christian Hammacher', 'Harald Schoening'];74f47cf8-2839-4a56-959a-524dd0ed9e3e;International Conference on Extending Database Technology;conference;7;2023.0;Barcelona;;;;;['Computer Science'];['7872f34e2a164c5cf3c34a7a7433dc3342b6c7ea', '168f28ac3c8c7ea63bf7ed25f2288e8b67e2fe74']

In this paper we explore instruction finetuning with a particular focus on (1) scaling the number of tasks, (2) scaling the model size, and (3) finetuning on chain-of-thought data. We find that instruction finetuning with the above aspects dramatically improves performance on a variety of model classes (PaLM, T5, U-PaLM), prompting setups (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT), and evaluation benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA, MGSM, open-ended generation). For instance, Flan-PaLM 540B instruction-finetuned on 1.8K tasks outperforms PALM 540B by a large margin (+9.4% on average). Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints, which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B.

It prompts distracted workers to resume their tasks by generating a continuation of their work and presenting it as an intervention that is more context-aware than conventional (predetermined) feedback. The prompt can function by drawing their interest and lowering the hurdle for resumption even when the generated continuation is insufficient to substitute their work, while recent human-AI collaboration research aiming at work substitution depends on a stable high accuracy. This frees CatAlyst from domain-specific model-tuning and makes it applicable to various tasks.

EMR data on 12 AEs for patients enrolled on two Children's Oncology Group (COG) trials at one institution were extracted, processed and graded. When compared to gold standard chart data, COG AE report sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPV) were 0–21·1% and 20–100%, respectively. EMR sensitivity and PPV were >98·2% for all AEs. These results demonstrate that EMR‐based AE ascertainment and grading substantially improves laboratory AE reporting accuracy.;['35225524', '121704382', '40552926', '50227754', '46718975', '2731349', '28575936', '21012984', '8226579', '2353025', '1867144', '5248294'];['Tamara P.

34f6569f8000a8a33ffe8820fe3a3bd91a02d3f2;ChatGPT's Response to the Diabetes Knowledge Questionnaire: Implications for Diabetes Education.;The diabetes epidemic which impacts many people globally necessitates patient education to enhance self-management. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots hold promise in automizing patient education and lessening healthcare providers' burden. This study assesses the utility of ChatGPT, an AI chatbot created by OpenAI, in responding to the diabetes knowledge questionnaire (24-DKQ). The 24-DKQ, consisting of 24 items, is specifically designed to evaluate patients' diabetes knowledge. We found that ChatGPT accurately answered all 24 questions of the 24-DKQ, and was also able to expand and provide decent explanations. AI technology can serve as an opportunity to create personalized and automated diabetes patient education materials. However, despite AI technology's great potential, its effectiveness remains unclear. It is crucial for researchers, developers, and healthcare professionals to collaborate in order to create AI programs that are validated, reliable, and accurately tailored to the individual needs of people living with diabetes.;['6998737', '2161976152', '152422777'];['Afif Nakhleh', 'Sivan Spitzer', 'N.

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to digitized whole slide images (WSIs) can aid pathologists in cancer diagnosis, but robust, diverse evidence in a simulated clinical setting is lacking. OBJECTIVE.— To compare the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists reading WSIs of prostatic biopsy specimens with and without AI assistance. DESIGN.— Eighteen pathologists, 2 of whom were genitourinary subspecialists, evaluated 610 prostate needle core biopsy WSIs prepared at 218 institutions, with the option for deferral. Two evaluations were performed sequentially for each WSI: initially without assistance, and immediately thereafter aided by Paige Prostate (PaPr), a deep learning-based system that provides a WSI-level binary classification of suspicious for cancer or benign and pinpoints the location that has the greatest probability of harboring cancer on suspicious WSIs.

This information leaks either through the model itself or through predictions made by the model. Consequently, when the training data contains sensitive attributes, assessing the amount of information leakage is paramount. We propose a method to quantify this leakage using the Fisher information of the model about the data. Unlike the worst-case a priori guarantees of differential privacy, Fisher information loss measures leakage with respect to specific examples, attributes, or sub-populations within the dataset. We motivate Fisher information loss through the Cramer-Rao bound and delineate the implied threat model. We provide efficient methods to compute Fisher information loss for output-perturbed generalized linear models. Finally, we empirically validate Fisher information loss as a useful measure of information leakage.;['144479015', '2110228691', '1803520'];['Awni Y. Hannun', 'Chuan Guo', 'L.

6ff75ef14c71e606d76ad186a8c9515344ecc9a9;Natural Language Processing Applications for Computer-Aided Diagnosis in Oncology;In the era of big data, text-based medical data, such as electronic health records (EHR) and electronic medical records (EMR), are growing rapidly. EHR and EMR are collected from patients to record their basic information, lab tests, vital signs, clinical notes, and reports. EHR and EMR contain the helpful information to assist oncologists in computer-aided diagnosis and decision making. However, it is time consuming for doctors to extract the valuable information they need and analyze the information from the EHR and EMR data. Recently, more and more research works have applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques, i.e., rule-based, machine learning-based, and deep learning-based techniques, on the EHR and EMR data for computer-aided diagnosis in oncology. The objective of this review is to narratively review the recent progress in the area of NLP applications for computer-aided diagnosis in oncology.

This paper offers some tentative answers, first conceptually, and then practically in an overview of the results of a number of experimental implementations documented in greater detail elsewhere. Our key finding is that artificial intelligence—in the context of the practices of electronic computing developing over the past three quarters of a century—will never in any sense “take over” the role of teacher, because how it works and what it does;['33955451', '2334862', '2693295'];['B.

6d0f8427064a7eaa04947a2ba4c91c98efa734da;Get a Model! Model Hijacking Attack Against Machine Learning Models;Machine learning (ML) has established itself as a cornerstone for various critical applications ranging from autonomous driving to authentication systems. However, with this increasing adoption rate of machine learning models, multiple attacks have emerged. One class of such attacks is training time attack, whereby an adversary executes their attack before or during the machine learning model training. In this work, we propose a new training time attack against computer vision based machine learning models, namely model hijacking attack. The adversary aims to hijack a target model to execute a different task than its original one without the model owner noticing. Model hijacking can cause accountability and security risks since a hijacked model owner can be framed for having their model offering illegal or unethical services. Model hijacking attacks are launched in the same way as existing data poisoning attacks. However, one requirement of the model hijacking attack is to be;['66697271', '144588806', '2145954003'];['A.

Large-scale knowledge graphs such as DBpedia, YAGO and Wikidata are published and widely used in various tasks. However, most of them are far from perfect and have many quality issues. For example, they may contain inaccurate or outdated entries and do not cover enough facts, which limits their credibility and further utility. Data quality has a long research history in the field of traditional relational data and recently attracts more knowledge graph experts. In this paper, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of the quality management on knowledge graphs, covering overall research topics about not only quality issues, dimentions and metrics, but also quality management processes from quality assessment and error detection,;['1577536005', '144554647'];['Bingcong Xue', 'Lei Zou'];;;;;;;rnodcuk2;IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering;2023.0;35;['Graph', 'Computer Science'];['0ca7d8c3250d43d14fdde46bf6fc299654d861ef', '789a7069d1a2d02d784e4821685b216cc63e6ec8', '8f096071a09701012c9c279aee2a88143a295935', '30321b036607a7936221235ea8ec7cf7c1627100', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '9ba0186ed40656329c421f55ada7313293e13f17', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', '53f1779c4169b128072e6f50dc3f31bb2c530a70', '54906484f42e871f7c47bbfe784a358b1448231f', '2cefe5adb11295b830ce27176c6d84b66fb20c2c', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '955fe2ee26d888ae22749b0853981b8b581b133d', '994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726', '2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05', '2582ab7c70c9e7fcb84545944eba8f3a7f253248', '834cb8e1e738b8d2c6d24e652ac966d6e7089a46', 'f6b51c8753a871dc94ff32152c00c01e94f90f09', '4e11ebdc3e4f30d774458fab9e4b45ff0d0aa971', '81a4fd3004df0eb05d6c1cef96ad33d5407820df']

This study replicates the primary findings of previous work in explanation-based category learning (Williams & Lombrozo, 2010), extending that work by illustrating the critical role of the context in this type of learning. Participants interacted with items from two categories either by describing the items or explaining their category membership. We manipulated the feature overlap between the categories and examined both the explanations generated and acquired knowledge of the categories. Explanations for membership in a given category were influenced by the unprompted contrast category, indicating an important role for contrastive processing in the generation of explanations. The influence of the contrast category was similarly seen in the transfer performance of the participants.;['1810680', '2321580174'];['Seth Chin-Parker', 'Julie Cantelon'];;;;;;;uwlsfiza;Cognitive science;2017.0;41 6;['Medicine', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];[]

We provide a comprehensive picture of the use of AI technologies and their impact among US firms over the last decade, using a unique combination of job postings and individual-level employment profiles. We introduce a novel measure of investments in AI technologies based on human capital and document that larger firms with higher sales, markups, and cash holdings tend to invest more in AI. Firms that invest in AI experience faster growth in both sales and employment, which translates into analogous growth at the industry level. The positive effects are concentrated among the ex ante largest firms, leading to a positive correlation between AI investments and an increase in industry concentration. However, the increase in concentration is not accompanied by either increased markups or increased productivity.

Methods We gathered ten research abstracts from five high impact factor medical journals (n=50) and asked ChatGPT to generate research abstracts based on their titles and journals. We evaluated the abstracts using an artificial intelligence (AI) output detector, plagiarism detector, and had blinded human reviewers try to distinguish whether abstracts were original or generated. Results All ChatGPT-generated abstracts were written clearly but only 8% correctly followed the specific journal’s formatting requirements. Most generated abstracts were detected using the AI output detector, with scores (higher meaning more likely to be generated) of median [interquartile range] of 99.98% [12.73, 99.98] compared with very low probability of AI-generated output in the original abstracts of 0.02% [0.02, 0.09].

b9b0bcfe881b6c90f76dfe7a913b0e022682ceb5;Research on the Impact of Geopolitical Instability on Russian Trade;This study examines how global and country- specific geopolitical instability affects Russian trade using data from 1996 to 2021. A panel regression model analyzes trade between Russia and its 15 top trading partners, exploring both direct and indirect effects. The analysis focuses on how accumulated foreign direct investment (FDI) and exchange rate fluctuations mediate these relationships. The findings reveal that global geopolitical instability decrease Russian trade by 0.0558. Interestingly, this negative impact is partially mediated by a decrease in FDI (-0.0805). This aligns with the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results, which show a significant negative effect of global geopolitical instability on FDI (-1.209). This suggests that FDI acts as a key transmitter of the negative effects of global instability on Russian trade. The role of exchange rate fluctuations, however, is more complex.

The fact of scarce liver resources makes the organ assigning crucial. Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is a widely adopted criterion when making organ distribution decisions. However, it ignores post-transplant outcomes and organ/donor features. These limitations motivate the emergence of machine learning (ML) models. Unfortunately, ML models could be unfair and trigger bias against certain groups of people. To tackle this problem, this work proposes a fair machine learning framework targeting graft failure prediction in liver transplant. Specifically, knowledge distillation is employed to handle dense and sparse features by combining the advantages of tree models and neural networks. A two-step debiasing method is tailored for this framework to enhance fairness. Experiments are conducted to analyze unfairness issues in existing models and demonstrate the superiority of our method in both prediction and fairness performance.;['153112833', '2057059798', '1759658', '49648991', '2153280096', '2155408529', '2109724398'];['Sirui Ding', 'Ruixiang Tang', 'D.

This is motivated via accounts of both trust and distrust in terms of perceived commitment. Avoiding unfufilled commitments is crucial both to practical trustworthiness, and to trustworthiness in speech; on this picture, assertion involves promising to speak truthfully, and simultaneously either keeping that promise or breaking it. Both assertion and the incurring of practical commitments are governed by competence norms, as well as norms of sincerity. So what should we do if we want to be trustworthy? Two perspectives are important: we need to act in line with our existing commitments, but in addition we need to approach potential new commitments with care. We can become untrustworthy by taking on too many—or over-challenging—commitments, no matter how well-meaning we are. Considered narrowly, trustworthiness typically directs us away from new commitments, but this creates significant costs both for";['144168564'];['K.

82d9f1db6db43cb61fe4b0b26a489a2e72628675;A Test for Evaluating Performance in Human-Computer Systems;The Turing test for comparing computer performance to that of humans is well known, but, surprisingly, there is no widely used test for comparing how much better human-computer systems perform relative to humans alone, computers alone, or other baselines. Here, we show how to perform such a test using the ratio of means as a measure of effect size. Then we demonstrate the use of this test in three ways. First, in an analysis of 79 recently published experimental results, we find that, surprisingly, over half of the studies find a decrease in performance, the mean and median ratios of performance improvement are both approximately 1 (corresponding to no improvement at all), and the maximum ratio is 1.36 (a 36% improvement). Second, we experimentally investigate whether a higher performance improvement ratio is obtained when 100 human programmers generate software using GPT-3, a massive, state-of-the-art AI system. In this case, we;['153604150', '153024015', '21524995', '2075349702', '3085084', '145850249'];['Andres Campero', 'Michelle Vaccaro', 'Jaeyoon Song', 'Haoran Wen', 'Abdullah Almaatouq', 'T.

4638c153cdefafcf5a80588ec93ade6a5558d490;SIMCal: A High-Performance Toolkit For Calibrating Traffic Simulation;Traffic simulators have many parameters that describe vehicle characteristics and driving behaviors. However, driving behaviors differ across urban, suburban, and rural areas. Even in the same area, driving behavior can be affected by the time of day or weather conditions. Therefore, it is difficult to get an accurate parameter set that is suitable for all scenarios. As a result, default parameters of simulators are usually determined only for a specific test case. To simulate a traffic scenario, researchers need to perform calibration to determine a suitable parameter set, which can provide more reliable simulated traffic than the default parameter set. A popular approach is manual calibration using human experience, but it is usually not effective due to the huge space of possible parameters. Although some studies proposed automated methods using evolutionary algorithms, implementing these methods is a time-consuming job.

Recent works show that a knowledge graph (KG) can complement text data, offering structured background knowledge that provides a useful scaffold for reasoning. However, these works are not pretrained to learn a deep fusion of the two modalities at scale, limiting the potential to acquire fully joint representations of text and KG. Here we propose DRAGON (Deep Bidirectional Language-Knowledge Graph Pretraining), a self-supervised approach to pretraining a deeply joint language-knowledge foundation model from text and KG at scale. Specifically, our model takes pairs of text segments and relevant KG subgraphs as input and bidirectionally fuses information from both modalities. We pretrain this model by unifying two self-supervised reasoning tasks, masked language modeling and KG link prediction.

A challenge for traditional methods in quality management is to handle high-dimensional and nonlinear manufacturing data. We address this challenge by adapting explainable artificial intelligence to the context of quality management. Specifically, we propose the use of nonlinear modeling with Shapley additive explanations to infer how a set of production parameters and the process quality of a manufacturing system are related. Thereby, we contribute a measure of process importance based on which manufacturers can prioritize processes for quality improvement. Grounded in quality management theory, our decision model selects improvement actions that target the sources of quality variation. The decision model is validated in a real-world application at a leading manufacturer of high-power semiconductors. Seeking to improve production yield, we apply our decision model to select improvement actions for a transistor chip product.

This affects sanitation and public human hygiene, deteriorates quality of life, and contributes to deprivation. This study aimed to test a combination of machine learning, high-resolution earth observation and GIS data to detect diverse categories of residual waste on the streets, such as sacks and construction debris. We conceptualised five different classes of solid waste from image interpretation: “Sure”, “Half-sure”, “Not-sure”, “Dispersed”, and “Non-garbage”. We tested a combination of k-means-based segmentation and supervised random forest to investigate the capabilities of automatic classification of these waste classes. The model can detect the presence of solid waste on the streets and achieved an accuracy of up from 73.95%–95.76% for the class “Sure”. Moreover, a building extraction using an EfficientNet deep-learning-based semantic segmentation allowed masking the rooftops. This improved the accuracy of the classes “Sure” and “Non-garbage”.

By adapting large language models (LLMs) for genomic data, we build genome-scale language models (GenSLMs) which can learn the evolutionary landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. By pre-training on over 110 million prokaryotic gene sequences and fine-tuning a SARS-CoV-2-specific model on 1.5 million genomes, we show that GenSLMs can accurately and rapidly identify variants of concern. Thus, to our knowledge, GenSLMs represents one of the first whole-genome scale foundation models which can generalize to other prediction tasks. We demonstrate scaling of GenSLMs on GPU-based supercomputers and AI-hardware accelerators utilizing 1.63 Zettaflops in training runs with a sustained performance of 121 PFLOPS in mixed precision and peak of 850 PFLOPS.

We provide a fast and objective method of scoring claims into different portfolios using available rating factors. Results from fitting several prediction models are compared based on not only the conventional loss prediction error function, but also a modified loss function. We demonstrate that the prediction power of all the data mining methods under consideration is clearly evident using a misclassification plot. We also point out that this predictability can be masked by looking at just the conventional prediction error function. We then suggest using the stepwise regression technique to reduce the number of variables used in the data mining methods. Apart from this variable selection method, we also look at principal components analysis to increase understanding of the rating factors that drive claim durations of insured lives.

Using a novel difference-in-differences event-study design leveraging lumpy investment, we find that automation increases the probability of incumbent workers separating from their employers. Workers experience a five-year cumulative wage income loss of 9% of one year’s earnings, driven by decreases in days worked. These adverse impacts of automation are larger in smaller firms, and for older and middle-educated workers. By contrast, no such losses are found for firms’ investments in computers.;['2315995098', '66669488', '9368010', '1405336513'];['James Bessen', 'M. Goos', 'A.

Trust is needed when we lack knowledge, yet we have most trust in those we know best. Trust bestowed can be both an honour and a burden; distrust is rarely welcome. Practical reasons to trust can outstrip the evidence, yet counter-evidence can make it impossible to trust. Recent philosophical work on trust has emphasised its importance to both epistemology and ethics, asking whether reasons to trust someone must be based on reasons to think her trustworthy (e.g. Hinchman 2005, Faulkner 2007, McGeer 2008, Hieronymi 2008). But this work, and the literature it builds upon, is curiously lopsided. To understand trust, we must also understand distrust, yet distrust is usually treated as a mere afterthought, or mistakenly equated with the absence of trust.

We examine those applications, consumer/product matching engines and user interfaces, as well as the early diffusion of AITs and some categories where laboratory AIT and application are closely linked. In the leading applications, AITs are core production technologies with hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. These production applications of AITs involve no substitution of machine for human work at the task level. The tasks undertaken by AIT in the leading applications were previously done by capital, not by human workers. Whatever your view of AITs, it should be updated to deal with this basic fact about their initial highly valuable applications. There is capital deepening, not factor substitution, at the task level. The absence of task-level substitution is unsurprising to scholars of ICT-based production. The transition to ICT-based production has largely proceeded at the system;['66546379'];['T.

However, most algorithms that learn comprehensible classifiers use classification model size as a metric that guides the search in the space of all possible classifiers instead of comprehensibility - which is ill-defined. Several surveys have shown that such simple complexity metrics do not correspond well to the comprehensibility of classification trees. This paper therefore suggests a classification tree comprehensibility survey in order to derive an exhaustive comprehensibility metrics better reflecting the human sense of classifier comprehensibility and obtain new insights about comprehensibility of classification trees;['1689869', '1723535', '10269507', '1403643862'];['Rok Piltaver', 'M.

To address this issue, we propose a new approach for detecting suspicious behavior as a means of preventing shoplifting. Existing methods are based on the use of convolutional neural networks that rely on extracting spatial features from pixel values. In contrast, our proposed method employs object detection based on YOLOv5 with Deep Sort to track people through a video, using the resulting bounding box coordinates as temporal features. The extracted temporal features are then modeled as a time-series classification problem. The proposed method was tested on the popular UCF Crime dataset, and benchmarked against the current state-of-the-art robust temporal feature magnitude (RTFM) method, which relies on the Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) preprocessing method.

This question is of critical importance in applications such as autonomous driving or medical imaging where collecting data is expensive and time-consuming. Overestimating or underestimating data requirements incurs substantial costs that could be avoided with an adequate budget. Prior work on neural scaling laws suggest that the power-law function can fit the validation performance curve and extrapolate it to larger data set sizes. We find that this does not immediately translate to the more difficult downstream task of estimating the required data set size to meet a target performance. In this work, we consider a broad class of computer vision tasks and systematically investigate a family of functions that generalize the power-law function to allow for better estimation of data requirements.

At the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital and labor—the task content of production. Automation, which enables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor because of a displacement effect. As a result, automation always reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the task content of production in favor of labor because of a reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and labor demand.

Popularised in the UK, this paper aims to extend and evaluate the applicability of science capital in the context of China by drawing on PISA2015. More specifically, we make use of existing items in the PISA2015 survey as a proxy for operationalising the construct of science capital to explore the science career aspirations and attainments of 15-year-old Chinese and UK students (n = 23,998). Our findings indicate that science capital has more explanatory power for understanding UK students’ science career aspirations than for Chinese students, where science attainment seems most important. We raise the potential challenge for Chinese students to convert their science capital into scientific self-efficacy and science career aspirations as we highlight the importance of recognising cultural and national differences in operationalising science capital.;['2114713781', '32664763'];['Xin Du', 'B.

Minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) is a particularly fast feature selection method for finding a set of both relevant and complementary features. Here we describe the mRMRe R package, in which the mRMR technique is extended by using an ensemble approach to better explore the feature space and build more robust predictors. To deal with the computational complexity of the ensemble approach, the main functions of the package are implemented and parallelized in C using the openMP Application Programming Interface. RESULTS Our ensemble mRMR implementations outperform the classical mRMR approach in terms of prediction accuracy. They identify genes more relevant to the biological context and may lead to richer biological interpretations. The parallelized functions included in the package show significant gains in terms of run-time speed when compared with previously released packages.

We argue that such an approach to solution development makes the outcome of solutions less explainable, i.e., it is often not possible to explain the results of the model. There is a growing concern among policymakers in cities with this lack of explainability of AI solutions, and this is considered a major hindrance in the wider acceptability and trust in such AI-based solutions. In this work, we survey the concept of ‘explainable deep learning’ as a subset of the ‘explainable AI’ problem and propose a new solution using Semantic Web technologies, demonstrated with a smart cities flood monitoring application in the context of a European Commission-funded project.

KG error detection has been intensively studied since real-world KGs inevitably contain erroneous triples. While existing studies focus on developing a novel algorithm dedicated to one or a few data characteristics, we explore advancing KG error detection by assembling a set of state-of-the-art (SOTA) KG error detectors. However, it is nontrivial to develop a practical ensemble learning framework for KG error detection. Existing ensemble learning models heavily rely on labels, while it is expensive to acquire labeled errors in KGs. Also, KG error detection itself is challenging since triples contain rich semantic information and might be false because of various reasons. To this end, we propose to leverage active learning to minimize human efforts.

We then develop a simple model where the returns to work experience are a race between on-the-job learning and skill obsolescence. Obsolescence lowers the return to experience, flattening the age-earnings profile in faster-changing careers. We show that the earnings premium for college graduates majoring in technology-intensive subjects such as computer science, engineering, and business declines rapidly, and that these graduates sort out of faster-changing occupations as they gain experience.;['47141782', '35346035'];['D.

Its management is therefore a key challenge in the construction industry. Many researchers have utilized waste generation data for waste management, and more accurate and efficient waste management plans have recently been prepared using artificial intelligence models. Here, we developed a hybrid model to forecast the demolition-waste-generation rate in redevelopment areas in South Korea by combining principal component analysis (PCA) with decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and linear regression algorithms. Without PCA, the decision tree model exhibited the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.872) and the k-nearest neighbors (Chebyshev distance) model exhibited the lowest (R2 = 0.627). The hybrid PCA–k-nearest neighbors (Euclidean uniform) model exhibited significantly better predictive performance (R2 = 0.897) than the non-hybrid k-nearest neighbors (Euclidean uniform) model (R2 = 0.664) and the decision tree model.

The AILEd studies published from 1990 to 2020 in the WOS (Web of Science) database were included in the present study. Based on the well-recognized Technology-based Learning Review model, several dimensions, such as research methods, research sample groups, adopted technology, language skills, the role of AI in language education, and learning outcomes, were taken into account. The review results show that the main application domains of AILEd research were writing, reading, and vocabulary acquisition. In terms of applied technology and algorithms, AI in language education mostly adopted ITS (Intelligent Tutoring System) and NLP (Natural Language Processing). Besides, several commonly used AI algorithms were Statistical Learning, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Parsing. It was also found that some research focused on learning anxiety, willingness to communicate, knowledge acquisition, and classroom interaction.

Analyzing Early Reactions to the Innovative AI Chatbot on Twitter";In this study, the author collected tweets about ChatGPT, an innovative AI chatbot, in the first month after its launch. A total of 233,914 English tweets were analyzed using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling algorithm to answer the question “what can ChatGPT do?”. The results revealed three general topics: news, technology, and reactions. The author also identified five functional domains: creative writing, essay writing, prompt writing, code writing, and answering questions. The analysis also found that ChatGPT has the potential to impact technologies and humans in both positive and negative ways. In conclusion, the author outlines four key issues that need to be addressed as a result of this AI advancement: the evolution of jobs, a new technological landscape, the quest for artificial general intelligence, and the progress-ethics conundrum.;['118468484'];['Viriya Taecharungroj'];;;;;;;okwu81kc;Big Data Cogn.

be3ec164145be75248950558918661e8babd32b2;Towards Explainable Shared Control using Augmented Reality;Shared control plays a pivotal role in establishing effective human-robot interactions. Traditional control-sharing methods strive to complement a human’s capabilities at safely completing a task, and thereby rely on users forming a mental model of the expected robot behaviour. However, these methods can often bewilder or frustrate users whenever their actions do not elicit the intended system response, forming a misalignment between the respective internal models of the robot and human. To resolve this model misalignment, we introduce Explainable Shared Control as a paradigm in which assistance and information feedback are jointly considered. Augmented reality is presented as an integral component of this paradigm, by visually unveiling the robot’s inner workings to human operators. Explainable Shared Control is instantiated and tested for assistive navigation in a setup involving a robotic wheelchair and a Microsoft HoloLens with add-on eye tracking. Experimental results indicate that the introduced paradigm facilitates transparent assistance by;['10708100', '1699337'];['Mark Zolotas', 'Y.

Some of these generative AI tools such as DALL-E, MidJourney, or ChatGPT have gained wide public notoriety. Interestingly, these tools are possible because of the massive amount of data (text and images) available on the Internet. The tools are trained on massive data sets that are scraped from Internet sites. And now, these generative AI tools are creating massive amounts of new data that are being fed into the Internet. Therefore, future versions of generative AI tools will be trained with Internet data that is a mix of original and AI-generated data.

The lack of explanations for the decisions of black box systems is a key ethical issue, and a limitation to the adoption of machine learning components in socially sensitive and safety-critical contexts. %Therefore, we need explanations that reveals the reasons why a predictor takes a certain decision. In this paper we focus on the problem of black box outcome explanation, i.e., explaining the reasons of the decision taken on a specific instance. We propose LORE, an agnostic method able to provide interpretable and faithful explanations. LORE first leans a local interpretable predictor on a synthetic neighborhood generated by a genetic algorithm.

60eaae8784648ca44c1b6100760ccafad03162ee;The Race between Man and Machine: Implications of Technology for Growth, Factor Shares, and Employment;We examine the concerns that new technologies will render labor redundant in a framework in which tasks previously performed by labor can be automated and new versions of existing tasks, in which labor has a comparative advantage, can be created. In a static version where capital is fixed and technology is exogenous, automation reduces employment and the labor share, and may even reduce wages, while the creation of new tasks has the opposite effects. Our full model endogenizes capital accumulation and the direction of research toward automation and the creation of new tasks. If the long-run rental rate of capital relative to the wage is sufficiently low, the long-run equilibrium involves automation of all tasks. Otherwise, there exists a stable balanced growth path in which the two types of innovations go hand-in-hand. Stability is a consequence of the fact that automation reduces the cost of producing using labor, and thus;['2660799', '2133941'];['D. Acemoglu', 'P.

3dbe2b18393c34dc30f057949e6d31e3ef6efd90;Deep neural network improves fracture detection by clinicians;Significance Historically, computer-assisted detection (CAD) in radiology has failed to achieve improvements in diagnostic accuracy, decreasing clinician sensitivity and leading to unnecessary further diagnostic tests. With the advent of deep learning approaches to CAD, there is great excitement about its application to medicine, yet there is little evidence demonstrating improved diagnostic accuracy in clinically-relevant applications. We trained a deep learning model to detect fractures on radiographs with a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of senior subspecialized orthopedic surgeons. We demonstrate that when emergency medicine clinicians are provided with the assistance of the trained model, their ability to accurately detect fractures significantly improves. Suspected fractures are among the most common reasons for patients to visit emergency departments (EDs), and X-ray imaging is the primary diagnostic tool used by clinicians to assess patients for fractures. Missing a fracture in a radiograph often has severe consequences for patients, resulting in delayed treatment and;['82808117', '6850399', '3295092', '32825659', '2114809026', '2066361397', '3638723', '2061751534', '2110760273', '31624927', '77736142'];['Rob Lindsey', 'A.

We build a novel measure of exposure to computer numerical control (CNC) based on initial variation in tool types across industries and differential shifts toward CNC technology by tool type over time. Industries more exposed to CNC increased capital investment and experienced higher labor productivity. Total employment rose, with gains for college-educated workers and abstract tasks compensating for losses of less-educated workers and routine tasks. Employment gains were strongest for unionized jobs. Workers in exposed industries returned to school and relevant degree programs expanded.

Common clinical tools and machine-learning (ML) models for screening osteoporosis have been developed, but they show limitations such as low accuracy. Moreover, these methods are confined to limited risk factors and lack individualized explanation. Objective The aim of this study was to develop an interpretable deep-learning (DL) model for osteoporosis risk screening with clinical features. Clinical interpretation with individual explanations of feature contributions is provided using an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique. Methods We used two separate data sets: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data sets from the United States (NHANES) and South Korea (KNHANES) with 8274 and 8680 respondents, respectively. The study population was classified according to the T-score of bone mineral density at the femoral neck or total femur.

As an AI language model, ChatGPT has the potential to transform geography and environmental education. The extensive knowledge base and natural language processing abilities that ChatGPT possesses make it a perfect tool for this purpose; it can actively include students in conversation (as the chat in its name implies) while also providing them with quick feedback. Because of this, students are free to progress through the material at their own pace, using strategies that best suit them individually. Yet, this change has been criticised by others who worry about intellectual property violations and undermining academic integrity. As discussions continue about whether generative AI models are a boon or bane for education, we would like to focus on the problems and potential facing geography and environmental education in particular.

It is estimated that over 30% of drug candidates are discarded owing to toxicity. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to improve drug toxicity prediction as it provides more accurate and efficient methods for identifying the potentially toxic effects of new compounds before they are tested in human clinical trials, thus saving time and money. In this review, we present an overview of recent advances in AI-based drug toxicity prediction, including the use of various machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures, of six major toxicity properties and Tox21 assay end points. Additionally, we provide a list of public data sources and useful toxicity prediction tools for the research community and highlight;['2202344452', '2216353627', '8652102', '1968184'];['Thi Tuyet Van Tran', 'Agung Surya Wibowo', 'Hilal Tayara', 'K.

b3639a751c631deee8bf1e7a6dd41d76d830b47b;Sharing Knowledge;Assertion is the central vehicle for the sharing of knowledge. Whether knowledge is shared successfully often depends on the quality of assertions: good assertions lead to successful knowledge sharing, while bad ones don't. In Sharing Knowledge, Christoph Kelp and Mona Simion investigate the relation between knowledge sharing and assertion, and develop an account of what it is to assert well. More specifically, they argue that the function of assertion is to share knowledge with others. It is this function that supports a central norm of assertion according to which a good assertion is one that has the disposition to generate knowledge in others. The book uses this functionalist approach to motivate further norms of assertion on both the speaker and the hearer side and investigates ramifications of this view for other questions about assertion.;['2778848', '7441236'];['Christoph Kelp', 'M.

So it is puzzling that much contemporary work on trust – such as that based on polling evidence – studies generic attitudes of trust in types of agent, institution or activity in complete abstraction from any account of trustworthiness. Information about others’ generic attitudes of trust or mistrust that take no account of evidence whether those attitudes are well or ill placed can offer little or no help for those who aim to place or refuse trust well. Information about attitudes is evidently useful to those who aim to influence those who hold them, which explains why polls about attitudes are popular with political parties, advertisers and other campaigning organisations. But where we aim not to influence others, but to place and refuse trust intelligently we must link;['116563084'];['O.

Given the recent advances in machine learning, it is particularly important to leverage the tools provided by the latest advances in computing. In this paper, we investigate the effects of including Python-based computer algebra system SymPy in university calculus courses. The advantages of SymPy include open-source, introduction to programming, and simplicity. Critically, comparison of the grades pre and post adoption of SymPy in calculus courses indicates a statistically significant improvement. Although further studies - based on a larger cohort - about the effectiveness of open-access computer algebra system are desirable, the initial findings suggest that SymPy provides a viable alternative to commercially available computer algebra system.;['32231986', '116925840', '91629349', '2218392276', '2135922763'];['F.

3de49d40bde9066c203cd7a04380483f39a907a5;Artificial intelligence explainability: the technical and ethical dimensions;In recent years, several new technical methods have been developed to make AI-models more transparent and interpretable. These techniques are often referred to collectively as ‘AI explainability’ or ‘XAI’ methods. This paper presents an overview of XAI methods, and links them to stakeholder purposes for seeking an explanation. Because the underlying stakeholder purposes are broadly ethical in nature, we see this analysis as a contribution towards bringing together the technical and ethical dimensions of XAI. We emphasize that use of XAI methods must be linked to explanations of human decisions made during the development life cycle. Situated within that wider accountability framework, our analysis may offer a helpful starting point for designers, safety engineers, service providers and regulators who need to make practical judgements about which XAI methods to employ or to require.

In contrast to prior studies that predict dramatic employment declines, we find that investments in robotics are associated with increases in total firm employment but decreases in the total number of managers. Similarly, we find that robots are associated with an increase in the span of control for supervisors remaining within the organization. We also provide evidence that robot adoption is not motivated by the desire to reduce labor costs but is instead related to improving product and service quality. Our findings are consistent with the notion that robots reduce variance in production processes, diminishing the need for managers to monitor worker activities to ensure production quality. As additional evidence, we also find that robot investments predict improved performance measurement and increased adoption of incentive pay based on individual employee performance.

In so doing, AI has already substituted human employment in areas that were previously thought to be uncomputerizable. Based on current trends, the technological displacement of labor is predicted to be significant in the future – if left unchecked this will lead to catastrophic societal unemployment levels. This paper presents a means to mitigate future technological unemployment through the introduction of a Basic Income scheme, accompanied by reforms in school curricula and retraining programs. Our proposal argues that such a scheme can be funded by a special tax on those industries that make use of robotic labour; it includes a practical roadmap that would see a government take this proposal from the conceptual phase and implement it nationwide in the span of one decade.";['121010968', '1391474920'];['E.

This paper seeks to answer the question: what post-COVID-19 digital competences are needed for a sustainable society? It also aims to analyze the digitalization processes in education for shaping a sustainable digital society. A bibliographic search was performed on some of the most relevant international databases of scientific literature and the selected documents were analyzed through a content analysis. It is concluded that digital education has experienced a strong increase, reinforced by COVID-19, shaping the digital presence in all dimensions of life. However, it is not sufficient to assume that the new generations are naturally engaged in and can master digital social sustainability. The results demonstrate the importance of literacy and the unavoidable promotion of sustainability in a digital society.

A consequence of this are more accurate alerts to farmers. Another is an increased ability to understand why phenomena occur in farm systems, so as to improve their management. From improved data and understanding come improved predictions, enabling more optimal decisions about how to manage farm systems and stimulating the development of decision support and recommender systems.

Specifically, high quality and diverse question generation can dramatically reduce the load on teachers and improve the quality of their educational content. Recent work in this domain has made progress with generation, but fails to show that real teachers judge the generated questions as sufficiently useful for the classroom setting; or if instead the questions have errors and/or pedagogically unhelpful content. We conduct a human evaluation with teachers to assess the quality and usefulness of outputs from combining CTG and question taxonomies (Bloom's and a difficulty taxonomy). The results demonstrate that the questions generated are high quality and sufficiently useful, showing their promise for widespread use in the classroom setting.";['2077591909', '2700917', '3159752', '35224828'];['Sabina Elkins', 'E.

We propose circumventing this issue by directly finding latent knowledge inside the internal activations of a language model in a purely unsupervised way. Specifically, we introduce a method for accurately answering yes-no questions given only unlabeled model activations. It works by finding a direction in activation space that satisfies logical consistency properties, such as that a statement and its negation have opposite truth values. We show that despite using no supervision and no model outputs, our method can recover diverse knowledge represented in large language models: across 6 models and 10 question-answering datasets, it outperforms zero-shot accuracy by 4\% on average.

The evidence with regard to the effect of extracorporeal CPR on survival with a favorable neurologic outcome in refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is inconclusive. METHODS In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial conducted in the Netherlands, we assigned patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to receive extracorporeal CPR or conventional CPR (standard advanced cardiac life support). Eligible patients were between 18 and 70 years of age, had received bystander CPR, had an initial ventricular arrhythmia, and did not have a return of spontaneous circulation within 15 minutes after CPR had been initiated. The primary outcome was survival with a favorable neurologic outcome, defined as a Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2 (range, 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating more severe disability) at 30 days.

7e27d24bf242671bc32115314d349a53abd5542c;The precision medicine process for treating rare disease using the artificial intelligence tool mediKanren;There are over 6,000 different rare diseases estimated to impact 300 million people worldwide. As genetic testing becomes more common practice in the clinical setting, the number of rare disease diagnoses will continue to increase, resulting in the need for novel treatment options. Identifying treatments for these disorders is challenging due to a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, small cohort sizes, interindividual symptom variability, and little commercial incentive to develop new treatments. A promising avenue for treatment is drug repurposing, where FDA-approved drugs are repositioned as novel treatments. However, linking disease mechanisms to drug action can be extraordinarily difficult and requires a depth of knowledge across multiple fields, which is complicated by the rapid pace of biomedical knowledge discovery. To address these challenges, The Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute developed an artificial intelligence tool, mediKanren, that leverages the mechanistic insight of genetic disorders to identify therapeutic options.

There has been an increasing influx of work on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in order to disentangle what is meant and expected by XAI. Nevertheless, there is no general consensus on how to produce and judge explanations. In this paper, we discuss why techniques integrating connectionist and symbolic paradigms are the most efficient solutions to produce explanations for non-technical users and we propose a reasoning model, based on definitions by Doran et al. [2017] (arXiv:1710.00794) to explain a neural network's decision. We use this explanation in order to correct bias in the network's decision rationale. We accompany this model with an example of its potential use, based on the image captioning method in Burns et al.

19b3f04f4314ea83025ad4537c7be4055b77cd2c;Towards Personalized Preprocessing Pipeline Search;Feature preprocessing, which transforms raw input features into numerical representations, is a crucial step in automated machine learning (AutoML) systems. However, the existing systems often have a very small search space for feature preprocessing with the same preprocessing pipeline applied to all the numerical features. This may result in sub-optimal performance since different datasets often have various feature characteristics, and features within a dataset may also have their own preprocessing preferences. To bridge this gap, we explore personalized preprocessing pipeline search, where the search algorithm is allowed to adopt a different preprocessing pipeline for each feature. This is a challenging task because the search space grows exponentially with more features. To tackle this challenge, we propose ClusterP3S, a novel framework for Personalized Preprocessing Pipeline Search via Clustering. The key idea is to learn feature clusters such that the search space can be significantly reduced by using the same preprocessing pipeline;['2210161657', '1759658', '9747941', '2109724398'];['Diego Martinez', 'D.

Radiomics is an emerging field that translates these medical images into quantitative data to enable phenotypic profiling of tumors. While radiomics has been associated with several clinical endpoints, the complex relationships of radiomics, clinical factors, and tumor biology are largely unknown. To this end, we analyzed two independent cohorts of respectively 262 North American and 89 European patients with lung cancer, and consistently identified previously undescribed associations between radiomic imaging features, molecular pathways, and clinical factors. In particular, we found a relationship between imaging features, immune response, inflammation, and survival, which was further validated by immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, a number of imaging features showed predictive value for specific pathways; for example, intra-tumor heterogeneity features predicted activity of RNA polymerase transcription (AUC = 0.62, p=0.03) and intensity dispersion was predictive of the autodegration pathway of a ubiquitin ligase (AUC = 0.69, p<10-4).";['49405431', '12428455', '1389997680', '145882824', '7229537', '40470674', '66906587', '1400863382', '1693233', '4579991', '143849569'];['P.

Our study of the history of impact assessments shows that ""impacts"" are an evaluative construct that enable actors to identify and ameliorate harms experienced because of a policy decision or system. Every domain has different expectations and norms around what constitutes impacts and harms, how potential harms are rendered as impacts of a particular undertaking, who is responsible for conducting such assessments, and who has the authority to act on them to demand changes to that undertaking. By examining proposals for AIAs in relation to other domains, we find that there is a distinct risk of constructing algorithmic impacts as organizationally understandable metrics that are nonetheless inappropriately distant from the harms experienced by people, and which fall short of building the relationships";['38480469', '2175081', '29830026', '2115875786', '21817215'];['Jacob Metcalf', 'E.

5fda8919788ee58647c9917dc50cef7ac4327250;The Productivity J-Curve: How Intangibles Complement General Purpose Technologies;General purpose technologies (GPTs) like AI enable and require significant complementary investments. These investments are often intangible and poorly measured in national accounts. We develop a model that shows how this can lead to underestimation of productivity growth in a new GPTs early years and, later, when the benefits of intangible investments are harvested, productivity growth overestimation. We call this phenomenon the Productivity J-curve. We apply our method to US data and find that adjusting for intangibles related to computer hardware and software yields a TFP level that is 15.9 percent higher than official measures by the end of 2017.

9e574373ef1e8b4ded223b9e70a1c1853314020f;Can Artificial Intelligence Improve the Readability of Patient Education Materials?;Abstract Background The recommended readability of online health education materials is at or below the sixth- to eighth-grade level. Nevertheless, more than a decade of research has demonstrated that most online education materials pertaining to orthopaedic surgery do not meet these recommendations. The repeated evidence of this limited progress underscores that unaddressed barriers exist to improving readability, such as the added time and cost associated with writing easily readable materials that cover complex topics. Freely available artificial intelligence (AI) platforms might facilitate the conversion of patient-education materials at scale, but to our knowledge, this has not been evaluated in orthopaedic surgery. Questions/purposes (1) Can a freely available AI dialogue platform rewrite orthopaedic patient education materials to reduce the required reading skill level from the high-school level to the sixth-grade level (which is approximately the median reading level in the United States)? (2) Were the converted materials accurate, and did they;['36652403', '2075447229', '12252481', '5446244'];['Gregory J. Kirchner', 'Raymond Y Kim', 'J. Weddle', 'Jesse E.

When they are introduced, they could have a variety of different negative effects, either as minor inconveniences or a severe problem. The aim of this review is to compile a list of invasive plant species across Asia and organize a set of data according to their reproduction rates, growth rates, dispersal rates, and characterize the allelochemicals they produce and allelopathic effects they have on their environment. The target is to know the extent of their spread ability in the area that they inhibit and know what control measures can be done with that specific species. The data has been gathered by compiling research articles and obtaining pertinent data relating to the objective.

8b6f5784419fcf9c1057e7a3599f030b3723b59b;Lightly-supervised Representation Learning with Global Interpretability;We propose a lightly-supervised approach for information extraction, in particular named entity classification, which combines the benefits of traditional bootstrapping, i.e., use of limited annotations and interpretability of extraction patterns, with the robust learning approaches proposed in representation learning. Our algorithm iteratively learns custom embeddings for both the multi-word entities to be extracted and the patterns that match them from a few example entities per category. We demonstrate that this representation-based approach outperforms three other state-of-the-art bootstrapping approaches on two datasets: CoNLL-2003 and OntoNotes. Additionally, using these embeddings, our approach outputs a globally-interpretable model consisting of a decision list, by ranking patterns based on their proximity to the average entity embedding in a given class. We show that this interpretable model performs close to our complete bootstrapping model, proving that representation learning can be used to produce interpretable models with small loss in performance. This decision list can be edited;['1403473008', '145773546', '1760868'];['M. A. Valenzuela-Escarcega', 'Ajay Nagesh', 'M.

d0d968351ecf60e10184175f9f64ef0f9a75d112;The AI Revolution in Education: Will AI Replace or Assist Teachers in Higher Education?;This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education, specifically its capacity to replace or assist human teachers. By reviewing relevant literature and analysing survey data from students and teachers, the study provides a comprehensive perspective on the future role of educators in the face of advancing AI technologies. Findings suggest that although some believe AI may eventually replace teachers, the majority of participants argue that human teachers possess unique qualities, such as critical thinking, creativity, and emotions, which make them irreplaceable. The study also emphasizes the importance of social-emotional competencies developed through human interactions, which AI technologies cannot currently replicate. The research proposes that teachers can effectively integrate AI to enhance teaching and learning without viewing it as a replacement. To do so, teachers need to understand how AI can work well with teachers and students while avoiding potential pitfalls, develop AI literacy, and address practical;['40588014', '2183404500'];['C.

6d5852cf840761ac76fbdebaaefd5f908ae8130b;Research on predicting learning achievement in a flipped classroom based on MOOCs by big data analysis;In the era of big data mining, educational data mining has become a principal research focus, with online education mining, such as massive open online courses' (MOOC) data analysis, representing an important source of it. Recent studies have found that learners have low passing rates on MOOCs. A number of studies have proposed prediction models for the dropout rate of learners on MOOCs. The improvement of MOOCs and the promotion of personalized education are the key points of online education. However, the selection and intervention of students with a tendency to drop out slows down the efficiency of teaching and increases the burden on teachers. This study's aim is to utilize back propagation neural networks and radar graphs in a flipped classroom based on MOOCs to predict students' future grades and to analyze the influence of teaching from various perspectives to support the promotion and reform of teaching and curriculum.;['2114897422', '49672552', '143781709', '152501500', '2099595684', '3372627'];['Yan Qian', 'Cheng-Hsuan Li', 'Xiuguo Zou', 'Xuebin Feng', 'Mao Xiao', 'Yongqian Ding'];;;;;;;q0zwoqd2;Computer Applications in Engineering Education;2021.0;30;['Computer Science', 'Big Data'];[]

18961b843e322bfea7f37cda5ef73fb0e432400c;Explainability-Based Mix-Up Approach for Text Data Augmentation;"Text augmentation is a strategy for increasing the diversity of training examples without explicitly collecting new data. Owing to the efficiency and effectiveness of text augmentation, numerous augmentation methodologies have been proposed. Among them, the method based on modification, particularly the mix-up method of swapping words between two or more sentences, is widely used because it can be applied simply and shows good levels of performance. However, the existing mix-up approaches are limited; they do not reflect the importance of the manipulated word. That is, even if a word that has a critical effect on the classification result is manipulated, it is not considered significant in labeling the augmented data. Therefore, in this study, we propose an effective text augmentation technique that explicitly derives the importance of manipulated words and reflects this importance in the labeling of augmented data. The importance of each word, in other words, explainability, is calculated,";['2163646521', '2110076764'];['Soonki Kwon', 'Younghoon Lee'];;;;;;;pwoaviz2;ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data;2023.0;17;['Computer Science'];['21dff47a4142445f83016da0819ffe6dd2947f66']
2c6df83795cd5baf3b8c6e2639b85e2df0cee1d0;Sustainable AI: Environmental Implications, Challenges and Opportunities;This paper explores the environmental impact of the super-linear growth trends for AI from a holistic perspective, spanning Data, Algorithms, and System Hardware. We characterize the carbon footprint of AI computing by examining the model development cycle across industry-scale machine learning use cases and, at the same time, considering the life cycle of system hardware.

fa02cd80e87cec4c78af29e5b9e754dfbe1922fd;SkiNet: A deep learning framework for skin lesion diagnosis with uncertainty estimation and explainability;Skin cancer is considered to be the most common human malignancy. Around 5 million new cases of skin cancer are recorded in the United States annually. Early identification and evaluation of skin lesions are of great clinical significance, but the disproportionate dermatologist-patient ratio poses a significant problem in most developing nations. Therefore a novel deep architecture, named as SkiNet, is proposed to provide faster screening solution and assistance to newly trained physicians in the process of clinical diagnosis of skin cancer. The main motive behind SkiNet’s design and development is to provide a white box solution, addressing a critical problem of trust and interpretability which is crucial for the wider adoption of Computer-aided diagnosis systems by medical practitioners. The proposed SkiNet is a two-stage pipeline wherein the lesion segmentation is followed by the lesion classification. Monte Carlo dropout and test time augmentation techniques have been employed in the proposed method;['2119122409', '1394608448', '1830416512', '2162250133'];['R. Singh', 'R.

Yet, urban non-college workers perform substantially less skilled jobs than decades earlier. This deskilling reflects the joint effects of automation and, secondarily, rising international trade, which have eliminated the bulk of non-college production, administrative support, and clerical jobs, yielding a disproportionate polarization of urban labor markets. The unwinding of the urban non-college occupational skill gradient has, I argue, abetted a secular fall in real non-college wages by: (1) shunting non-college workers out of specialized middle-skill occupations into low-wage occupations that require only generic skills; (2) diminishing the set of non-college workers that hold middle-skill jobs in high-wage cities; and (3) attenuating, to a startling degree, the steep urban wage premium for non-college workers that prevailed in earlier decades.

df99898ad6d997cd5b91bd2262e137a1d77fe152;An IoT Framework for Heart Disease Prediction Based on MDCNN Classifier;Nowadays, heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Predicting heart disease is a complex task since it requires experience along with advanced knowledge. Internet of Things (IoT) technology has lately been adopted in healthcare systems to collect sensor values for heart disease diagnosis and prediction. Many researchers have focused on the diagnosis of heart disease, yet the accuracy of the diagnosis results is low. To address this issue, an IoT framework is proposed to evaluate heart disease more accurately using a Modified Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MDCNN). The smartwatch and heart monitor device that is attached to the patient monitors the blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG). The MDCNN is utilized for classifying the received sensor data into normal and abnormal. The performance of the system is analyzed by comparing the proposed MDCNN with existing deep learning neural networks and logistic regression. The results demonstrate that the proposed MDCNN;['1736591'];['Mohammad Ayoub Khan'];;;;;;;pvmzdfn5;IEEE Access;2020.0;8;['Computer Science'];['f779d3c8427bc47fa0b6ecde4ff6173e47afc1f2']

The development of AI technologies that can produce text that will pass plagiarism detectors and are capable of appearing to be written by a human author present new issues for medical ethics. One set of worries concerns authorship and whether it will now be possible to know that an author or student in fact produced submitted work. That seems likely to be a general worry for secondary and higher education, as well as for all academic journals. Thus far generative AI chatbots do not seem to be able to produce a fully referenced and wellargued ethics article, but they probably could generate a blog or student essay that would be hard to detect after very minor edits.

a9bd625a66c8cb1cf6841faaa82862d55debf98f;Efficient and Privacy-Enhanced Federated Learning for Industrial Artificial Intelligence;By leveraging deep learning-based technologies, industrial artificial intelligence (IAI) has been applied to solve various industrial challenging problems in Industry 4.0. However, for privacy reasons, traditional centralized training may be unsuitable for sensitive data-driven industrial scenarios, such as healthcare and autopilot. Recently, federated learning has received widespread attention, since it enables participants to collaboratively learn a shared model without revealing their local data. However, studies have shown that, by exploiting the shared parameters adversaries can still compromise industrial applications such as auto-driving navigation systems, medical data in wearable devices, and industrial robots’ decision making. In this article, to solve this problem, we propose an efficient and privacy-enhanced federated learning (PEFL) scheme for IAI. Compared with existing solutions, PEFL is noninteractive, and can prevent private data from being leaked even if multiple entities collude with each other. Moreover, extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the superiority of PEFL in terms of;['2062622282', '49404145', '2963962', '145249315', '2804297', '2144328693'];['Meng Hao', 'Hongwei Li', 'Xizhao Luo', 'Guowen Xu', 'Haomiao Yang', 'Sen Liu'];;;;;;;z83vvjuq;IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics;2020.0;16;['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence'];[]

People use many behavioural cues to infer others' intentions, such as deliberative actions, facial expressions, eye gaze, and gestures. In artificial intelligence, two approaches for intention recognition, among others, are gaze-based and model-based intention recognition. Approaches in the former class use gaze to determine which parts of a space a person looks at more often to infer a person's intention. Approaches in the latter use models of possible future behaviour to rate intentions as more likely if they are a better 'fit' to observed actions. In this paper, we propose a novel model of human intention recognition that combines gaze and model-based approaches for online human intention recognition. Gaze data is used to build probability distributions over a set of possible intentions, which are then used as priors in a model-based intention recognition;['3090846', '144658641', '2508003', '1719425', '2520424', '97607538'];['Ronal Singh', 'Tim Miller', 'Joshua Newn', 'L.

Although many approaches have been proposed to improve the efficiency of XAI methods, a comprehensive understanding of the achievements and challenges is still needed. To this end, in this paper we provide a review of efficient XAI. Specifically, we categorize existing techniques of XAI acceleration into efficient non-amortized and efficient amortized methods. The efficient non-amortized methods focus on data-centric or model-centric acceleration upon each individual instance. In contrast, amortized methods focus on learning a unified distribution of model explanations, following the predictive, generative, or reinforcement frameworks, to rapidly derive multiple model explanations.

We show that the wage for new hires is rigid downward but flexible upward, in two steps. First, the nominal wage rarely changes at the job level. When wages do change, they fall infrequently. Second, when unemployment rises, wages do not fall — but wages do rise strongly as unemployment falls. We show prior strategies cannot detect downward rigidity due to job composition. Then with a standard model, we argue downward wage rigidity at the job level is key for unemployment fluctuations.

We ﬁnd that the AI improves drivers’ productivity by shortening the time to search for customers by 5% on average. Importantly, the productivity gain is concentrated on low-skilled drivers (10%) whereas the corresponding gain on high-skilled drivers is nearly zero. This result suggests that AI, unlike past technologies, may not accompany skill-biased technological change.;['88739143', '3590539', '39725258', '2109740563'];['Kyogo Kanazawa', 'Daiji Kawaguchi', 'H.

d844490ca2edb76c76e1b460b7e84875e4f21b11;Why to Buy Insurance? An Explainable Artificial Intelligence Approach;We propose an Explainable AI model that can be employed in order to explain why a customer buys or abandons a non-life insurance coverage. The method consists in applying similarity clustering to the Shapley values that were obtained from a highly accurate XGBoost predictive classification algorithm. Our proposed method can be embedded into a technologically-based insurance service (Insurtech), allowing to understand, in real time, the factors that most contribute to customers’ decisions, thereby gaining proactive insights on their needs. We prove the validity of our model with an empirical analysis that was conducted on data regarding purchases of insurance micro-policies. Two aspects are investigated: the propensity to buy an insurance policy and the risk of churn of an existing customer. The results from the analysis reveal that customers can be effectively and quickly grouped according to a similar set of characteristics, which can predict their buying or churn behaviour well.;['2044795062', '144630568'];['Alex Gramegna', 'Paolo Giudici'];;;;;;;tj7ygh25;Risks;2020.0;94;['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence'];[]

e56dd32ea2436bdaeef7c64df29b221f013e795e;Why Interpretability in Machine Learning? An Answer Using Distributed Detection and Data Fusion Theory;As artificial intelligence is increasingly affecting all parts of society and life, there is growing recognition that human interpretability of machine learning models is important. It is often argued that accuracy or other similar generalization performance metrics must be sacrificed in order to gain interpretability. Such arguments, however, fail to acknowledge that the overall decision-making system is composed of two entities: the learned model and a human who fuses together model outputs with his or her own information. As such, the relevant performance criteria should be for the entire system, not just for the machine learning component. In this work, we characterize the performance of such two-node tandem data fusion systems using the theory of distributed detection. In doing so, we work in the population setting and model interpretable learned models as multi-level quantizers. We prove that under our abstraction, the overall system of a human with an interpretable classifier;['1712865', '4386787', '1999188219', '2116575168', '1925309'];['Kush R.

Recent advances in machine learning, especially with regard to deep learning, are helping to identify, classify, and quantify patterns in medical images. At the core of these advances is the ability to exploit hierarchical feature representations learned solely from data, instead of features designed by hand according to domain-specific knowledge. Deep learning is rapidly becoming the state of the art, leading to enhanced performance in various medical applications. We introduce the fundamentals of deep learning methods and review their successes in image registration, detection of anatomical and cellular structures, tissue segmentation, computer-aided disease diagnosis and prognosis, and so on. We conclude by discussing research issues and suggesting future directions for further improvement.;['144986260', '46531894', '143802908'];['D.

Most research activity reported so far in the eXplainable AI (XAI) research arena has stressed on proposing new techniques for eliciting such explanations, together with different approaches for measuring their effectivity to increase the trustworthiness of the audience for which explanations are furnished. However, alternative uses of explanations beyond their original purpose have been very scarcely explored. In this work we investigate whether local explanations can be utilized for detecting Out-of-Distribution (OoD) test samples in machine learning classifiers, i.e., to identify whether query examples of an already trained classification model can be thought to belong to the distribution of the training data. To this end, we devise and assess the performance of a clustering-based OoD detection approach that exemplifies how heatmaps produced by well-established local explanation methods can be;['2184789062', '9221552', '46387576'];['Aitor Martínez-Seras', 'J.

Nevertheless, the development of virtual agents that show aggressive behavior may also be interesting for a range of application domains, varying from aggression de-escalation training to anti-bullying education. However, ensuring that such aggressive agents achieve the desired effect is not easy, as they need to be believable in a number of aspects. In particular, they need to bring their human conversation partners into a serious state of anxiety. To investigate to what extent this can be achieved using state-of-the-art virtual agent technology, an experiment was performed in which the impact of an aggressive virtual agent was compared with that of an aggressive human. By randomly distributing a group of 28 participants over two conditions (virtual and human) and measuring their physiological and subjective emotional state before and after an aggressive outburst of their conversation;['2582595', '145518106', '144668050', '2073075733', '144287490'];['R.

In this paper, we extend a recently introduced technique for opponent modelling based on Theory of Mind reasoning. Our extended multi-agent Theory of Mind model explicitly considers multiple opponents simultaneously. We introduce a stereotyping mechanism, which segments the agent population into sub-groups of agents with similar behaviour. Sub-group profiles guide decision making. We evaluate our model using a multi-player stochastic game, which presents agents with the challenge of unknown adversaries in a partially-observable environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the model performs well under uncertainty and that stereotyping allows larger groups of agents to be modelled robustly. The findings show that Theory of Mind modelling is useful in many artificial intelligence applications.;['2799026', '1745256', '144658641'];['Friedrich Burkhard von der Osten', 'M.

The essays in this book explore the tacit dimension of architecture in its aesthetic, material, cultural, design-based, and reflexive understanding of what we build. Tacit knowledge, described in 1966 by Michael Polanyi as what we ‘can know but cannot tell’, often denotes knowledge that escapes quantifiable dimensions of research. Much of architecture’s knowledge resides beneath the surface, in nonverbal instruments such as drawings and models that articulate the spatial imagination of the design process. Awareness of the tacit dimension helps to understand the many facets of the spaces we inhabit, from the ideas of the architect to the more hidden assumptions of our cultures. Beginning in the studio, where students are guided into becoming architects, the book follows a path through the tacit knowledge present in materials, conceptual structures, and the design process, revealing;['9775757'];['Sarah Brown'];;;;;;;xxvkzi9a;Science Magazine (2021.0);2021.0;30;[];[]

When scaled to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervision, the resulting models generalize well to standard benchmarks and are often competitive with prior fully supervised results but in a zero-shot transfer setting without the need for any fine-tuning. When compared to humans, the models approach their accuracy and robustness.

With IoT and 5G advancement, intelligent sensors, and devices in the surveillance environment collect large amounts of data in the form of videos and images. These collected data require intelligent information processing solutions, help analyze the recorded videos and images to detect and identify various objects in the scene, particularly humans. In this study, an automated human detection system is presented for a complex industrial environment, in which people are monitored/detected from a top view perspective. A top view is usually preferred because it can provide sufficient coverage and enough visibility of a scene. This study demonstrates the applications, efficiency, and effectiveness of deep learning architectures, that is, Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R‐CNN), Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), and You Only Look Once (YOLOv3), with transfer learning.;['144188958', '3330245', '1798121'];['Imran Ahmed', 'M.

According to these criteria, the representative definitions in the field are analyzed. A new definition is proposed, according to it intelligence means “adaptation with insufficient knowledge and resources.” The implications of this definition are discussed, and it is compared with the other definitions. It is claimed that this definition sheds light on the solution of many existing problems and sets a sound foundation for the field.;['48319476'];['Pei Wang'];;;;;;;k5q9kfcw;Journal of Artificial General Intelligence;2019.0;10;['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence'];['de4b9bc12ddb6b9f6090c032ef5c6290bd64ef36']

Due to large number of patients, efficient treatments for viral cancers are needed. De novo drug discovery is time consuming and expensive process with high failure rate in clinical stages. To address this problem and provide treatments to patients suffering from viral cancers faster, drug repurposing emerges as an effective alternative which aims to find the other indications of the Food and Drug Administration approved drugs. Applied to viral cancers, drug repurposing studies following the niche have tried to find if already existing drugs could be used to treat viral cancers.

When these two technologies are combined, the ethical, legal and societal issues increase substantially, become much more complex, and can be scaled enormously, which increases the impact. Adding to these complexities, both genomics and AI-enabled technologies are rife with scientific and technological uncertainties, which makes the regulation of these technologies not only challenging in itself, but also creates legal uncertainties. In science, the precautionary principle has been used globally to govern uncertainty, with the specific aim to prevent irreversible harm to human beings. The regulation of uncertainties in AI-enabled technologies is based on risk as set out in the AI Regulation that was recently proposed by the European Commission.

b34fc78de28be598e21118d7cb9d84d63374addc;Analysis of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques on Big Data;Due to digitization, a huge volume of data is being generated across several sectors such as healthcare, production, sales, IoT devices, Web, organizations. Machine learning algorithms are used to uncover patterns among the attributes of this data. Hence, they can be used to make predictions that can be used by medical practitioners and people at managerial level to make executive decisions. Not all the attributes in the datasets generated are important for training the machine learning algorithms. Some attributes might be irrelevant and some might not affect the outcome of the prediction. Ignoring or removing these irrelevant or less important attributes reduces the burden on machine learning algorithms. In this work two of the prominent dimensionality reduction techniques, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are investigated on four popular Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Decision Tree Induction, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes Classifier and Random Forest Classifier;['38608914', '49247239', '51017707', '46234199', '32336300', '2176030144', '2287603163', '2176030144'];['G.

A persistent source of ""big data,"" or data that is enormous in volume, diverse in type, and has a complicated multidimensional structure, is internet applications and communications. Today, several measures are routinely performed with no assurance that any of them will be helpful in understanding the phenomenon of interest in an era of automatic, large-scale data collection. Online transactions that involve buying, selling, or even investing are all examples of e-commerce. As a result, they generate data that has a complex structure and a high dimension. The usual data storage techniques cannot handle those enormous volumes of data. There is a lot of work being done to find ways to minimize the dimensionality of big data in order to provide analytics reports that are even more accurate and data visualizations that are more interesting.";['2269971203', '2261850659'];['Wasnaa Kadhim Jawad', 'Abbas M.

a0d18dddaa995b126ad373e33767b9b881d16b2f;An Introductory Review of Deep Learning for Prediction Models With Big Data;Deep learning models stand for a new learning paradigm in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Recent breakthrough results in image analysis and speech recognition have generated a massive interest in this field because also applications in many other domains providing big data seem possible. On a downside, the mathematical and computational methodology underlying deep learning models is very challenging, especially for interdisciplinary scientists. For this reason, we present in this paper an introductory review of deep learning approaches including Deep Feedforward Neural Networks (D-FFNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Autoencoders (AEs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models form the major core architectures of deep learning models currently used and should belong in any data scientist's toolbox. Importantly, those core architectural building blocks can be composed flexibly—in an almost Lego-like manner—to build new application-specific network architectures. Hence, a basic understanding of these network architectures is;['1399003993', '1698784963', '2113276011', '89377594', '1792351'];['F. Emmert-Streib', 'Zhenyi Yang', 'Han Feng', 'S. Tripathi', 'M.

Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech?

b904dcdbd7c7b33938583f2f57d05ca70e121ea9;An Efficient and Secure Big Data Storage in Cloud Environment by Using Triple Data Encryption Standard;In recent decades, big data analysis has become the most important research topic. Hence, big data security offers Cloud application security and monitoring to host highly sensitive data to support Cloud platforms. However, the privacy and security of big data has become an emerging issue that restricts the organization to utilize Cloud services. The existing privacy preserving approaches showed several drawbacks such as a lack of data privacy and accurate data analysis, a lack of efficiency of performance, and completely rely on third party. In order to overcome such an issue, the Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) methodology is proposed to provide security for big data in the Cloud environment. The proposed TDES methodology provides a relatively simpler technique by increasing the sizes of keys in Data Encryption Standard (DES) to protect against attacks and defend the privacy of data. The experimental results showed that the proposed TDES method is;['2186480691', '2200758545', '2150706913', '65965701', '2200528122', '2143272549'];['Mohan Naik Ramachandra', 'Madala Srinivasa Rao', 'W.

1d174f0e3c391368d0f3384a144a6c7487f2a143;Big Data's Disparate Impact;Advocates of algorithmic techniques like data mining argue that these techniques eliminate human biases from the decision-making process. But an algorithm is only as good as the data it works with. Data is frequently imperfect in ways that allow these algorithms to inherit the prejudices of prior decision makers. In other cases, data may simply reflect the widespread biases that persist in society at large. In still others, data mining can discover surprisingly useful regularities that are really just preexisting patterns of exclusion and inequality. Unthinking reliance on data mining can deny historically disadvantaged and vulnerable groups full participation in society. Worse still, because the resulting discrimination is almost always an unintentional emergent property of the algorithm’s use rather than a conscious choice by its programmers, it can be unusually hard to identify the source of the problem or to explain it to a court.This Essay examines these concerns through;['2881033', '46432110'];['Solon Barocas', 'Andrew D.

94deb62af3054c49e7d80bd7eb3ed5efe990fc0b;Traffic Flow Prediction With Big Data: A Deep Learning Approach;Accurate and timely traffic flow information is important for the successful deployment of intelligent transportation systems. Over the last few years, traffic data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Existing traffic flow prediction methods mainly use shallow traffic prediction models and are still unsatisfying for many real-world applications. This situation inspires us to rethink the traffic flow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big traffic data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction.

When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment-the target experiment or target trial-that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.;['40362338', '145607066'];['M.

The model is fitted and tested using publicly available 1993 I-880 loop data. It is compared with basic and mean updating forecasting models.

Modern concerns about public safety and security include a focus on a range of events from less serious everyday crimes like shoplifting through to personal violent crimes like homicide and ultimately to terrorism. Underlying all of these events is a decision process or chain of steps in target identification, steps that focus first on rough and vague decisions and move towards the precise.

On the other hand, the massive sample size and high dimensionality of Big Data introduce unique computational and statistical challenges, including scalability and storage bottleneck, noise accumulation, spurious correlation, incidental endogeneity, and measurement errors. These challenges are distinguished and require new computational and statistical paradigm.

021660297056b96ad3182eb0c3da17ebbe1f4c4f;An Oscillatory Neural Autoencoder Based on Frequency Modulation and Multiplexing;Oscillatory phenomena are ubiquitous in the brain. Although there are oscillator-based models of brain dynamics, their universal computational properties have not been explored much unlike in the case of rate-coded and spiking neuron network models. Use of oscillator-based models is often limited to special phenomena like locomotor rhythms and oscillatory attractor-based memories. If neuronal ensembles are taken to be the basic functional units of brain dynamics, it is desirable to develop oscillator-based models that can explain a wide variety of neural phenomena. Autoencoders are a special type of feed forward networks that have been used for construction of large-scale deep networks. Although autoencoders based on rate-coded and spiking neuron networks have been proposed, there are no autoencoders based on oscillators. We propose here an oscillatory neural network model that performs the function of an autoencoder. The model is a hybrid of rate-coded neurons and neural oscillators.

ff2e999357bbcb4e9f27de17697e21e9a9b53597;A New Reinforcement Learning Based Learning Rate Scheduler for Convolutional Neural Network in Fault Classification;Convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained increasing attention in fault classification. However, the performance of CNN is sensitive to its learning rate. Some previous works have been done to tune the learning rate, including the “trial and error” and manual search, which heavily depend on the experts’ experiences and should be conducted repeatedly on every dataset. Because of the variety of the fault data, it is time-consuming and labor intensive to use these traditional tuning methods for fault classification. To overcome this problem, in this article, we develop a novel learning rate scheduler based on the reinforcement learning (RL) for convolutional neural network (RL-CNN) in fault classification, which can schedule the learning rate efficiently and automatically. First, a new RL agent is designed to learn the policies about the learning rate adjustment during the training process. Second, a new structure of RL-CNN is developed to balance the exploration and exploitation;['7564853', '1574064065', '145276267'];['Long Wen', 'Xinyu Li', 'Liang Gao'];;;;;;;fp2lkwsx;IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics;2021.0;68;['Computer Science'];[]

We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.;['2841331', '39611591', '144629422', '3319373', '2743563', '2465270', '2274215058', '46352821', '2280399', '1802148', '39328010', '2815290'];['Alexey Dosovitskiy', 'Lucas Beyer', 'Alexander Kolesnikov', 'Dirk Weissenborn', 'Xiaohua Zhai', 'Thomas Unterthiner', 'Mostafa Dehghani', 'Matthias Minderer', 'G.

c09e8ff287fdf58afc5ac691c512a1b33dd799f9;Providence;Artificial intelligence provides the opportunity to reveal important information buried in large amounts of complex data. Electronic health records (eHRs) are a source of such big data that provide a multitude of health related clinical information about patients. However, text data from eHRs, e.g., discharge summary notes, are challenging in their analysis because these notes are free-form texts and the writing formats and styles vary considerably between different records.

One possible application of machine learning is to perform unsupervised anomaly detection. Indeed, among all available data, the anomalies are supposed to be very sparse and the expert might not have the time to label all the data as nominal or not. Many solutions exist to this unsupervised problem, but are known to provide many false alarms, because some scarce nominal modes might not be included in the training dataset and thus will be detected as anomalies. To tackle this issue, we propose to present an existing iterative algorithm, which presents potential anomaly to the expert at each iteration, and compute a new boundary according to this feedback using One Class Support Vector Machine.;['51258589', '1742027'];['Julien Lesouple', 'J.

As baby boomers retire and the female participation rate plateaus, the U.S. economy will receive significantly less lift from increases in the labor force and will have to rely increasingly on productivity gains to fuel growth. The report finds that the United States needs a 34% acceleration in productivity growth if it is to match the GDP growth rates of the past 20 years and that this is possible. Three-quarters of the necessary productivity growth acceleration can come from the efforts of private-sector companies operating within the current regulatory and business environment.

The activities performed over the network could be effortlessly proliferated, which has led to the emergence of intrusion detection systems. The patterns of the attacks are also dynamic, which necessitates efficient classification and prediction of cyber attacks. In this paper we propose a hybrid principal component analysis (PCA)-firefly based machine learning model to classify intrusion detection system (IDS) datasets. The dataset used in the study is collected from Kaggle. The model first performs One-Hot encoding for the transformation of the IDS datasets. The hybrid PCA-firefly algorithm is then used for dimensionality reduction. The XGBoost algorithm is implemented on the reduced dataset for classification. A comprehensive evaluation of the model is conducted with the state of the art machine learning approaches to justify the superiority of our proposed approach.;['2286538930', '2127823435', '29919430', '46234199', '144704227', '11041265', '2474250', '51230514'];['S.

Fog system extends storing and computing to the edge of the network, which can solve the problem about service computing of the delay-sensitive applications remarkably besides enabling the location awareness and mobility support. Load balancing is an important aspect of fog networks that avoids a situation with some under-loaded or overloaded fog nodes. Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as resource utilization, throughput, cost, response time, performance, and energy consumption can be improved with load balancing. In recent years, some researches in load balancing techniques in fog networks have been carried out, but there is no systematic review to consolidate these studies. This article reviews the load-balancing mechanisms systematically in fog computing in four classifications, including approximate, exact, fundamental, and hybrid methods (published between 2013 and August 2020).

During wafer fabrication, several types of defects can be coupled together in a piece of wafer, it is called mixed-type defects DPR. To detect mixed-type defects is much more complicated because the combination of defects may vary a lot, from the type of defects, position, angle, number of defects, etc. Deep learning methods have been a good choice for complex pattern recognition problems. In this article, we propose a deformable convolutional network (DC-Net) for mixed-type DPR (MDPR) in which several types of defects are coupled together in a piece of wafer. A deformable convolutional unit is designed to selectively sample from mixed defects, then extract high-quality features from wafer maps.

94d20254f6a5ed3102d95eb55b87b62b2f731108;A Deep Learning Ensemble Approach for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection;Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an ophthalmic disease that damages retinal blood vessels. DR causes impaired vision and may even lead to blindness if it is not diagnosed in early stages. DR has five stages or classes, namely normal, mild, moderate, severe and PDR (Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy). Normally, highly trained experts examine the colored fundus images to diagnose this fatal disease. This manual diagnosis of this condition (by clinicians) is tedious and error-prone. Therefore, various computer vision-based techniques have been proposed to automatically detect DR and its different stages from retina images. However, these methods are unable to encode the underlying complicated features and can only classify DR’s different stages with very low accuracy particularly, for the early stages. In this research, we used the publicly available Kaggle dataset of retina images to train an ensemble of five deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models (Resnet50, Inceptionv3, Xception, Dense121, Dense169) to encode;['1389963882', '3266367', '47973472', '2066075', '1925224', '143721686', '1389963574', '2942350'];['Sehrish Qummar', 'F.

While we know that the well-understood algorithms for factoring large composites and solving the discrete logarithm problem run at best in superpolynomial time on conventional computers, new, less well understood algorithms run in polynomial time on certain quantum computer architectures. Many appear to be heralding this next step in computing as ‘the end of public key encryption’. We argue that this is not the case and that there are many fields of mathematics that can be used for creating ‘quantum resistant’ cryptographic schemes. We present a high-level review of the threat posed by quantum computers, using RSA and Shor’s algorithm as an example but we explain why we feel that the range of quantum algorithms that pose a threat to public key encryption schemes is likely to be;['34319573', '82546517'];['W.

Although current methods for aligning protein sequences are powerful, challenges remain, including problems with homologous overextension of alignments and with regions under convergent evolution. Here, we test the ability of the profile hidden Markov model method HMMER3 to correctly assign homologous sequences to >13 000 manually curated families from the Pfam database. We identify problem families using protein regions that match two or more Pfam families not currently annotated as related in Pfam. We find that HMMER3 E-value estimates seem to be less accurate for families that feature periodic patterns of compositional bias, such as the ones typically observed in coiled-coils. These results support the continued use of manually curated inclusion thresholds in the Pfam database, especially on the subset of families that have been identified as problematic;['40353699', '46699896', '1708077', '46888415', '2245929'];['Jaina Mistry', 'R.

With the development of deep learning in recent years, we can effectively improve agricultural production efficiency by existing agricultural data sets to build deep learning algorithm models. There are new ideas to explore the standard architecture of agricultural big data. By formulating standard and standardizing agricultural data process, we established a standard architecture of agricultural big data for deep learning. The result can promote the implementation of deep learning application, and support standardization of technological achievements transformation in agricultural big data.;['66988922', '100680094'];['Xiaojun Cui', 'Zihang Gao'];;;;;;;rakzpmwc;2020 IEEE International Conference on Advances in Electrical Engineering and Computer Applications( AEECA);2020.0;98;['Deep Learning', 'Computer Science', 'Big Data'];[]

Digital twin is an emerging life management and certification paradigm whereby models and simulations consist of as-built vehicle state, as-experienced loads and environments, and other vehicle-specific history to enable high-fidelity modeling of individual aerospace vehicles throughout their service lives. The digital twin concept spans many disciplines, and an extensive study on the full domain is out of the scope of this study. Therefore, as it pertains to the digital twin, this research focused on one major concept: modeling specifically the as-manufactured geometry of a component and its microstructure (to the degree possible). The second aspect of this research was to develop the concept of sensory materials such that they can be employed within the digital twin framework.

To do so, we exploit a recently introduced feature of Twitter known as ""lists"" to distinguish between elite users - by which we mean celebrities, bloggers, and representatives of media outlets and other formal organizations - and ordinary users. Based on this classification, we find a striking concentration of attention on Twitter, in that roughly 50% of URLs consumed are generated by just 20K elite users, where the media produces the most information, but celebrities are the most followed. We also find significant homophily within categories: celebrities listen to celebrities, while bloggers listen to bloggers etc; however, bloggers in general rebroadcast more information than the other categories.

The result of deviations in geometry on the order of tenths of a millimeter, this ambiguity in crack path motivates the consideration of as-manufactured component geometry in the design, assessment, and certification of structural systems. Herein, finite element models of as-manufactured specimens are generated and subsequently analyzed to resolve the crack-path ambiguity. The consequence and benefit of such a “personalized” methodology is the prediction of a crack path for each specimen based on its as-manufactured geometry, rather than a distribution of possible specimen geometries or nominal geometry. The consideration of as-manufactured characteristics is central to the Digital Twin concept.

However, these technical features also bring network security risks to the real-time price signal of the smart grid. The real-time price attack (RTPA) can maliciously raise the real-time price in smart meter, resulting in an increase in electrical customers load demand, causing the extensive damage to the power transmission lines due to overload. In this paper, we based on the behavioral relationship between load demand of electrical customers and real-time price of electricity suppliers (ES), defined the game relationship between RTPA, ES, and electrical customers, established a price elasticity of electricity demand (PEED) model, and proposed a defensive strategy of real-time price attack based on multiperson zero-determinant strategy (MPZDS).

cdcf7cb29f37ac0546961ea8a076075b9cc1f992;Mining and summarizing customer reviews;Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product.

3815675396c3328d2af7344fdca3df42d2258b8a;A Bootstrap Metropolis–Hastings Algorithm for Bayesian Analysis of Big Data;Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have proven to be a very powerful tool for analyzing data of complex structures. However, their computer-intensive nature, which typically require a large number of iterations and a complete scan of the full dataset for each iteration, precludes their use for big data analysis. In this article, we propose the so-called bootstrap Metropolis–Hastings (BMH) algorithm that provides a general framework for how to tame powerful MCMC methods to be used for big data analysis, that is, to replace the full data log-likelihood by a Monte Carlo average of the log-likelihoods that are calculated in parallel from multiple bootstrap samples. The BMH algorithm possesses an embarrassingly parallel structure and avoids repeated scans of the full dataset in iterations, and is thus feasible for big data problems. Compared to the popular divide-and-combine method, BMH can be generally more efficient as it can asymptotically integrate the whole;['2518560', '2145214742', '2286217299'];['F.

We develop a new framework to rigorously perform multiple hypothesis testing in linear asset pricing models, while limiting the occurrence of false positive results typically associated with data snooping. By exploiting a variety of machine learning techniques, our multiple-testing procedure is robust to omitted factors and missing data. We also prove its asymptotic validity when the number of tests is large relative to the sample size, as in many finance applications. To improve the finite sample performance, we also provide a wild-bootstrap procedure for inference and prove its validity in this setting. Finally, we illustrate the empirical relevance in the context of hedge fund performance evaluation.;['69847461', '2087014908', '90286912'];['Stefano Giglio', 'Yuan Liao', 'D.

The number and complexity of new attacks continue to rise; therefore, effective and intelligent solutions are necessary. Unsupervised machine learning techniques are particularly appealing to intrusion detection systems since they can detect known and unknown types of attacks as well as zero-day attacks. In the current paper, we present an unsupervised anomaly detection method, which combines Sub-Space Clustering (SSC) and One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to detect attacks without any prior knowledge. The proposed approach is evaluated using the well-known NSL-KDD dataset.

Some microstructure features with high explanatory power exhibit low predictive power, while others with less explanatory power have more predictive power. We find that some microstructure-based measures are useful for out-of-sample prediction of various market statistics, leading to questions about market efficiency. We also show how microstructure measures can have important cross-asset effects.

These “information blocking” practices would privately benefit vendors and providers but limit the societal quality and efficiency benefits from EHR adoption. We found that information blocking is reported to frequently occur among EHR vendors as well as hospitals and health systems, and that it is perceived to be motivated by opportunities for revenue gain. Because information blocking is largely legal today, the most effective policy response likely involves a combination of direct enforcement and the altering of market conditions that promote information blocking.

With HDFS, large data sets can be managed on commodity hardware. MapReduce is a programming model for processing vast amounts of data in parallel. Mapping and reducing can be performed by using the MapReduce programming framework. A very large amount of data is transferred from Mapper to Reducer without any filtering or recursion, resulting in overdrawn bandwidth. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm called Inner MAPping Combiner (IMapC) for the map phase. This algorithm in the Mapper combines the values of recurring keys. In order to test the efficiency of the algorithm, different approaches were tested. According to the test, MapReduce programs that are implemented with the Default Combiner (DC) of IMapC will be 70% more efficient than those that are implemented without one. To make computations significantly faster, this work can be combined with MapReduce.;['47902813', '1990046850', '2125355276', '2137743363'];['C. Kavitha', 'S. Srividhya', 'Wenchen Lai', 'V.

The effective fusion of multiple modalities (e.g., text, acoustic, or visual frames) is a non-trivial task, as these modalities, often, carry distinct and diverse information, and do not contribute equally. The issue further escalates when these data contain noise. In this article, we study the concept of multi-task learning for multi-modal affect analysis and explore a contextual inter-modal attention framework that aims to leverage the association among the neighboring utterances and their multi-modal information. In general, sentiments and emotions have inter-dependence on each other (e.g., anger → negative or happy → positive). In our current work, we exploit the relatedness among the participating tasks in the multi-task framework.

Although human beings can recognize and interpret facial expressions, the identification of correct facial expressions continues to be a key and challenging task by computer systems. The main issues stem from the face's non-uniform design and variations in conditions such as light, facial structure, and posture.

Edge computing is introduced to offload terminals’ tasks to meet the quality of service requirements such as low delay and energy consumption. By offloading computation tasks, edge servers can enable terminals to collaboratively run the highly demanding applications in acceptable delay requirements. However, existing schemes barely consider the characteristics of the edge server, which leads to random assignment of tasks among servers and big tasks with high computational intensity (named as “big task”) may be assigned to servers with low ability. In this paper, a task is divided into several subtasks and subtasks are offloaded according to characteristics of edge servers, such as transmission distance and central processing unit (CPU) capacity. With this multi-subtasks-to-multi-servers model, an adaptive offloading scheme based on Hungarian algorithm is proposed with low complexity.

In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks.;['2113243762', '51021910', '3271933', '1403239967', '3469062', '2065248680'];"['Hugo Touvron', 'M.

However, the effects of the most widely used Hct target in the past 2 decades, 34.5%–39%, have never been examined. Objective:To compare the effects of 2 Hct target strategies—30.0%–34.5% (low) and 34.5%–39.0% (mid) in a high-risk population: elderly dialysis patients with significant comorbidities. Research Design:Observational data from the US Renal Data System were used to emulate a randomized trial in which patients were assigned to either Hct strategy. Follow-up started after completing 3 months of hemodialysis and ended 6 months later. We conducted the observational analogs of intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.

5897798666a7090952b0b1bcf448976bebb07318;StreamCloud: An Elastic and Scalable Data Streaming System;Many applications in several domains such as telecommunications, network security, large-scale sensor networks, require online processing of continuous data flows. They produce very high loads that requires aggregating the processing capacity of many nodes. Current Stream Processing Engines do not scale with the input load due to single-node bottlenecks. Additionally, they are based on static configurations that lead to either under or overprovisioning. In this paper, we present StreamCloud, a scalable and elastic stream processing engine for processing large data stream volumes. StreamCloud uses a novel parallelization technique that splits queries into subqueries that are allocated to independent sets of nodes in a way that minimizes the distribution overhead. Its elastic protocols exhibit low intrusiveness, enabling effective adjustment of resources to the incoming load. Elasticity is combined with dynamic load balancing to minimize the computational resources used.

44f1c3aa7090c39fc80a9b490cc63e6921136220;A data-driven robust optimization method for the assembly job-shop scheduling problem under uncertainty;ABSTRACT This paper studies the production scheduling problem in an assembly manufacturing system with uncertain processing time and random machine breakdown. The objectives of minimizing makespan and the performance deviation of the actual schedule from the baseline schedule are simultaneously considered. Specifically, a boosting radial basis function network constructed using the data generated by Monte Carlo method, is used as the surrogate model to approximate the performance deviation. After that, a modified master-apprentice evolutionary algorithm (MAE) is developed for robust scheduling. In the design of MAE, we employ an extended adjacency matrix of subassemblies to cope with the sequential constraints of operations in AJSSP. Based on this, effective neighbourhood structures and distance metric of solutions are designed for tabu search and path relinking operators to generate feasible schedules. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a series of computational experiments are conducted.

We show that these terms are not only becoming popular but are also relevant to supply chain research and education. Data science requires both domain knowledge and a broad set of quantitative skills, but there is a dearth of literature on the topic and many questions. We call for research on skills that are needed by SCM data scientists and discuss how such skills and domain knowledge affect the effectiveness of a SCM data scientist. Such knowledge is crucial to developing future supply chain leaders. We propose definitions of data science and predictive analytics as applied to supply chain management.

Although fine prediction methodologies have been reported, most prediction methods with current time-series data lead to inefficient predictions when current or future time-series data either exhibit fluctuations or abruptly change. In order to deal with this problem, a dynamic multi-interval traffic volume prediction model, based on the k-nearest neighbour non-parametric regression (KNN-NPR), is introduced in this study. In an empirical study with real-world data, the input parameters of the proposed model including the k-values for the nearest neighbours in the neighbourhood and the dm-values for the number of lags were optimised according to the multi-interval prediction horizon in order to immediately capture the directionality of the future states and to minimise the prediction errors. The presented model performed effectively in terms of prediction accuracy, despite multi-interval schemes, to the same degree as applications of the real ITS,;['144996982', '2119397919', '145564489', '69481547'];['Hyun-ho Chang', 'Yuna Lee', 'Byoung-jo Yoon', 'S.

123505ca9c7e1272ad10d89a3e7a4caa89716395;A Collaborative Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm in Distributed Network Environments;Due to privacy and security requirements or technical constraints, traditional centralized approaches to data clustering in a large dynamic distributed peer-to-peer network are difficult to perform. In this paper, a novel collaborative fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed, in which the centralized clustering solution is approximated by performing distributed clustering at each peer with the collaboration of other peers. The required communication links are established at the level of cluster prototype and attribute weight. The information exchange only exists between topological neighboring peers. The attribute-weight-entropy regularization technique is applied in the distributed clustering method to achieve an ideal distribution of attribute weights, which ensures good clustering results. And the important features are successfully extracted for the high-dimensional data clustering. The kernelization of the proposed algorithm is also realized as a practical tool for clustering the data with “nonspherical”-shaped clusters. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated the efficiency and superiority;['2145786051', '47978588', '2118171924', '47893273'];['Jin Zhou', 'C. L. P.

Accurately estimated traffic flow forecasts are important for operating effective and proactive traffic management systems in the context of dynamic traffic assignment. For predicting short-term traffic flows, recent traffic information is clearly a more significant indicator of the near-future traffic flow. In other words, the relative significance depending on the time difference between traffic flow data should be considered. Although there have been several research works for short-term traffic flow predictions, they are offline methods. This paper presents a novel prediction model, called online learning weighted support-vector regression (OLWSVR), for short-term traffic flow predictions. The OLWSVR model is compared with several well-known prediction models, including artificial neural network models, locally weighted regression, conventional support-vector regression, and online learning support-vector regression.

However, traditional recommendation techniques usually exploit user’s rating or feedback information, which are impractical as such kind of user preference information is difficult to collect in the SIoT environment. In addition, temporal context plays an important role in smart object recommendation since most users tend to utilize different objects at different time slots in a day, e.g., making coffee at morning and playing games on weekends. In this article, we propose a time-aware smart object recommendation model by jointly considering user’s preference over time and smart object’s social similarity. We first learn user’s preference over time from his/her object usage events with a latent probabilistic model. Then, we estimate the smart object’s social similarity by embedding their heterogeneous social relationships into;['16098577', '94175902', '2629922', '145335174'];['Yuanyi Chen', 'Mingxuan Zhou', 'Zengwei Zheng', 'Dan Chen'];;;;;;;efrk5nz9;IEEE Internet of Things Journal;2020.0;7;['Computer Science'];['2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05']

Recently, mobile sink based technology provides an alternative solution for the long-distance communication and sensor nodes only need to use single hop communication to the mobile sink during data transmission. Even though it is difficult to consider many network metrics such as sensor position, residual energy and coverage rate etc., it is still very important to schedule a reasonable moving trajectory for the mobile sink.

While there are two major types of SEM including covariance-based SEM (CB-SEM) and variance-based SEM (PLS-SEM), the former dominated previous tourism research. However, increasing use of PLS-SEM in tourism research has been witnessed in recent years. This upward trend is likely to persist in the near future given the growing popularity of PLS-SEM in other social sciences domains like marketing, strategic management, and management information system, as specified in the preface of the book.

9cbbef97db445bd9399294b6f5cdb7014028db27;Distributed Modeling in a MapReduce Framework for Data-Driven Traffic Flow Forecasting;With the availability of increasingly more new data sources collected for transportation in recent years, the computational effort for traffic flow forecasting in standalone modes has become increasingly demanding for large-scale networks. Distributed modeling strategies can be utilized to reduce the computational effort. In this paper, we present a MapReduce-based approach to processing distributed data to design a MapReduce framework of a traffic forecasting system, including its system architecture and data-processing algorithms. The work presented here can be applied to many traffic forecasting systems with models requiring a learning process (e.g., the neural network approach). We show that the learning process of the forecasting model under our framework can be accelerated from a computational perspective. Meanwhile, model fusion, which is the key problem of distributed modeling, is explicitly treated in this paper to enhance the capability of the forecasting system in data processing and storage.;['2145774468', '2145286246', '153493834', '2133436293', '2148898379'];['Cheng Chen', 'Zhong Liu', 'Wei-Hua Lin', 'S.

0740b2764e5e437b297ac0049a5765749b68549a;The Anticlassification Turn in Employment Discrimination Law;The distinction between antisubordination and anticlassification has existed since the 1970s and has been frequently invoked by scholars to advocate for certain readings of antidiscrimination law. The anticlassification principle prohibits practices that classify people on the basis of a forbidden category. In contrast, the antisubordination principle allows classification (or consideration of, for example, race or sex) to the extent the classification is intended to challenge group subordination.While most scholars writing about antisubordination and anticlassification have done so in the context of equal protection, this Article systematically applies antisubordination and anticlassification values to assess recent developments in employment discrimination law and explore how they might tell us something about the trajectory of employment discrimination jurisprudence. In 2009, the Supreme Court decided Ricci v. DeStefano, a landmark Title VII case, and in 2008 Congress passed two new laws: the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act;['117039633'];['Bradley A.

Data hiding method is the process of storing the medical information of the patient in the medical image in the hidden format. Many existing data hiding methods are based on wavelet and chaotic map due to its effectiveness. Wavelet based methods have limitations of lack of phase information, poor directionality, and shift sensitivity. Chaotic map is applied to improve the security of the medical image and chaotic map has the limitation of low sensitive to control parameters and initial conditions. In this research, the Improved Chaos Encryption (ICE) is applied to improve the security based on randomness.

In some special practical applications, the uploaded data from SDs to vehicle base stations (VBSs) or servers can be merged between SDs with a fixed size, which is called superposed data. In this article, we consider the superposed data uploading problem in a decentralized device-to-device communication system. The task of the problem is to minimize the total energy consumption of uploading data. We reduce it into a combinatorial optimization problem from the graph theory perspective. For VBSs or servers with infinite capacities, we propose an optimal algorithm with polynomial running time. When VBSs or servers have limited capacities, the problem is NP-hard even in very special cases. For this NP-hard problem, we give two heuristic algorithms and the corresponding numerical simulation results.;['2108953789', '2109369025', '2108525317', '47795723', '9198774', '2143717413', '46529767'];['Wenjun Li', 'Huayi Xu', 'Huixi Li', 'Yongjie Yang', 'P.

2b6e67582e078eec249f9acdaec936ab4427d6ea;Process Mining: Overview and Opportunities;Over the last decade, process mining emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis of processes using event data. Classical data mining techniques such as classification, clustering, regression, association rule learning, and sequence/episode mining do not focus on business process models and are often only used to analyze a specific step in the overall process. Process mining focuses on end-to-end processes and is possible because of the growing availability of event data and new process discovery and conformance checking techniques. Process models are used for analysis (e.g., simulation and verification) and enactment by BPM/WFM systems. Previously, process models were typically made by hand without using event data. However, activities executed by people, machines, and software leave trails in so-called event logs. Process mining techniques use such logs to discover, analyze, and improve business processes.

This promising technology has immense potential for making life much easier and open new opportunities for newly developed applications to emerge. However, meeting the diverse Quality of Service (QoS) demands of different applications remains a formidable topic due to diverse traffic patterns, unpredictable network traffic, and resource-limited nature of IoT devices. In this context, application-tailored QoS provisioning mechanisms have been the primary focus of academic research. This paper presents a literature review on QoS techniques developed in academia for IoT applications and investigates current research trends. Background knowledge on IoT, QoS metrics, and critical enabling technologies will be given beforehand, delving into the literature review. According to the comparison presented in this work, the commonly considered QoS metrics are Latency, Reliability, Throughput, and Network;['100980586', '2295756603', '3093729'];['F.

We identified individual-level diurnal and seasonal mood rhythms in cultures across the globe, using data from millions of public Twitter messages. We found that individuals awaken in a good mood that deteriorates as the day progresses—which is consistent with the effects of sleep and circadian rhythm—and that seasonal change in baseline positive affect varies with change in daylength. People are happier on weekends, but the morning peak in positive affect is delayed by 2 hours, which suggests that people awaken later on weekends.;['32196493', '1863307'];['Scott A. Golder', 'M.

When applying machine learning, obtaining ground-truth labels for supervised learning is more difficult than in many more common applications of machine learning. This is especially so for datasets with abnormalities, as tissue types and the shapes of the organs in these datasets differ widely. However, organ detection in such an abnormal dataset may have many promising potential real-world applications, such as automatic diagnosis, automated radiotherapy planning, and medical image retrieval, where new multimodal medical images provide more information about the imaged tissues for diagnosis. Here, we test the application of deep learning methods to organ identification in magnetic resonance medical images, with visual and temporal hierarchical features learned to categorize object classes from an unlabeled multimodal DCE-MRI dataset so that only a weakly supervised training is required for a classifier.

They argue that the companies with the highest level of returns to their technology investment are doing more than just buying technology; they are inventing new forms of organizational capital to become digital organizations. These innovations include a cluster of organizational and business-process changes, including broader sharing of information, decentralized decision-making, linking pay and promotions to performance, pruning of non-core products and processes, and greater investments in training and education. Brynjolfsson and Saunders go on to examine the real sources of value in the emerging information economy, including intangible inputs and outputs that have defied traditional metrics.

8ac0d3ecbe24d458cab199e97bbab04340d8951c;An Unequal Deep Learning Approach for 3-D Point Cloud Segmentation;Object segmentation for 3-D point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous driving, robotic navigation, and other computer version applications. In object segmentation, all points are considered to be equal of importance in the literature. However, unequal cases exist and a segmentation boundary is mainly determined by neighbor points. To investigate point inequivalence, in this article, an unequal learning approach is proposed to integrate gene expression programming (GEP) and a deep neural network (DNN). GEP is designed to discover the inequivalent function, which measures the importance of different points according to the distances to the segmentation boundary. A cost sensitive learning method is improved to guide the DNN to obtain the loss of different points unequally with the discovered inequivalent function during model training. The experimental results reveal that point inequivalence with respect to boundary distance exists and is helpful to improve the accuracy of object segmentation.;['46584628', '153250242', '2092229113', '50561597', '2068352939'];['Junliang Wang', 'Chuqiao Xu', 'Lu Dai', 'Jie Zhang', 'Ray Y.

e0833220c257bdf31fd99261576cc7d4129adbc1;Visualizing Flow of Uncertainty through Analytical Processes;Uncertainty can arise in any stage of a visual analytics process, especially in data-intensive applications with a sequence of data transformations. Additionally, throughout the process of multidimensional, multivariate data analysis, uncertainty due to data transformation and integration may split, merge, increase, or decrease. This dynamic characteristic along with other features of uncertainty pose a great challenge to effective uncertainty-aware visualization. This paper presents a new framework for modeling uncertainty and characterizing the evolution of the uncertainty information through analytical processes. Based on the framework, we have designed a visual metaphor called uncertainty flow to visually and intuitively summarize how uncertainty information propagates over the whole analysis pipeline. Our system allows analysts to interact with and analyze the uncertainty information at different levels of detail. Three experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and intuitiveness of our design.;['121962020', '3181335', '1707383'];['Yingcai Wu', 'Guo-Xun Yuan', 'K.

However, DL is sensitive to image quality, and it is hard to collect enough high-quality defect images. The low-quality images usually lose some useful information and may mislead the DL methods into poor results. To overcome this problem, this article proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based DL method for low-quality defect image recognition. A GAN is used to reconstruct the low-quality defect images, and a VGG16 network is built to recognize the reconstructed images. The experimental results under low-quality defect images show that the proposed method achieves very good performances, which has accuracies of 95.53–99.62% with different masks and noises, and they are improved greatly compared with the other methods. Furthermore, the results on PSNR, SSIM, cosine, and mutual information indicate that the quality of the reconstructed image is improved greatly, which is very helpful for defect analysis.;['1488660121', '145276267', '1574064065'];['Yiping Gao', 'Liang Gao', 'Xinyu Li'];;;;;;;0873s5lk;IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics;2021.0;17;['Deep Learning', 'Computer Science'];['2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d']

Having more dimensions makes data analysis cumbersome increasing the sparsity of data points due to the problem called “curse of dimensionality“. To address this problem, global dimensionality reduction techniques are used; however, these techniques are ineffective in revealing hidden outliers from the high-dimensional space. This is due to the behaviour of outliers being hidden in the subspace where they belong; hence, a locally relevant subspace is needed to reveal the hidden outliers. In this paper, we present a technique that identifies a locally relevant subspace and associated low-dimensional subspaces by deriving a final correlation score. To verify the effectiveness of the technique in determining the generalised locally relevant subspace, we evaluate the results with a benchmark data set.

Consequently, for small datasets, people usually use shallow and simple additional layers on top of pre-trained models during fine-tuning. This work shows that this does not always need to be the case: with proper initialization and optimization, the benefits of very deep transformers can carry over to challenging tasks with small datasets, including Text-to-SQL semantic parsing and logical reading comprehension. In particular, we successfully train 48 layers of transformers, comprising 24 fine-tuned layers from pre-trained RoBERTa and 24 relation-aware layers trained from scratch. With fewer training steps and no task-specific pre-training, we obtain the state of the art performance on the challenging cross-domain Text-to-SQL parsing benchmark Spider. We achieve this by deriving a novel Data dependent Transformer Fixed-update initialization scheme (DT-Fixup), inspired by the prior T-Fixup work.

Purpose To review the shortcomings of intention-to-treat analyses, and of ‘as treated’ and ‘per protocol’ analyses as commonly implemented, with an emphasis on problems that are especially relevant for comparative effectiveness research. Methods and Results In placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, intention-to-treat analyses underestimate the treatment effect and are therefore nonconservative for both safety trials and noninferiority trials. In randomized clinical trials with an active comparator, intention-to-treat estimates can overestimate a treatment’s effect in the presence of differential adherence. In either case, there is no guarantee that an intention-to-treat analysis estimates the clinical effectiveness of treatment. Inverse probability weighting, g-estimation, and instrumental variable estimation can reduce the bias introduced by nonadherence and loss to follow-up in ‘as treated’ and ‘per protocol’ analyses. Limitations These analyse require untestable assumptions, a dose-response model, and time-varying;['40362338', '1398305782'];['M. Hernán', 'S.

In order to address these potential problems, this paper proposes a data storage framework not only enabling efficient storing of massive IoT data, but also integrating both structured and unstructured data. This data storage framework is able to combine and extend multiple databases and Hadoop to store and manage diverse types of data collected by;['30000987', '39466716', '1720869', '2157747150', '1732336', '2219053320'];['Lihong Jiang', 'Lida Xu', 'Hongming Cai', 'Zuhai Jiang', 'Fenglin Bu', 'Boyi Xu'];;;;;;;87ay87dd;IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics;2014.0;10;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];[]

16e0361afc68b2c71cab43b21abf482da69b33d0;Shroud: ensuring private access to large-scale data in the data center;Recent events have shown online service providers the perils of possessing private information about users. Encrypting data mitigates but does not eliminate this threat: the pattern of data accesses still reveals information. Thus, we present Shroud, a general storage system that hides data access patterns from the servers running it, protecting user privacy. Shroud functions as a virtual disk with a new privacy guarantee: the user can look up a block without revealing the block's address. Such a virtual disk can be used for many purposes, including map lookup, microblog search, and social networking.Shroud aggressively targets hiding accesses among hundreds of terabytes of data. We achieve our goals by adapting oblivious RAM algorithms to enable large-scale parallelization. Specifically, we show, via new techniques such as oblivious aggregation, how to securely use many inexpensive secure coprocessors acting in parallel to improve request latency. Our evaluation combines large-scale emulation with an implementation;['1855395', '2291514', '8983726', '1702744', '145727396'];['Jacob R. Lorch', 'Bryan Parno', 'James W.

43366ceccb11d03f3e413ba4b0f49808fce7f582;Is the Road to Disparate Impact Paved With Good Intentions? -- Stuck on State of Mind in Antidiscrimination Law;"The disparate impact theory of liability in antidiscrimination law is in its fourth decade of doctrinal development, but the theory remains misunderstood, mislabeled, and misused. Despite the fact that the effects-based theory emerged as a method of proof theoretically unconcerned with the concept of intent - whether of the ""good"" or ""bad"" variety - all of the stakeholders using disparate impact theory have remained stuck on state of mind. This Article examines the particular way in which the focus on the defendant's state of mind in disparate impact cases has helped undermine the theory, despite the belief of many theorists that a thorough grounding in intent may be necessary to ensure the theory's survival. The Article suggests that recent events and more modern conceptions of evil make it possible for us to look past ""good intentions,"" to revisit our notions of culpability and fault, and to reinvigorate a disparate impact";['113671068'];['Stacy E.

407388e4d16ac19bd04ed34114fc24cbe81b93ac;Big Data Quality: A Quality Dimensions Evaluation;Data is the most valuable asset companies are proud of. When its quality degrades, the consequences are unpredictable, can lead to complete wrong insights. In Big Data context, evaluating the data quality is challenging, must be done prior to any Big data analytics by providing some data quality confidence. Given the huge data size, its fast generation, it requires mechanisms, strategies to evaluate, assess data quality in a fast, efficient way. However, checking the Quality of Big Data is a very costly process if it is applied on the entire data. In this paper, we propose an efficient data quality evaluation scheme by applying sampling strategies on Big data sets. The Sampling will reduce the data size to a representative population samples for fast quality evaluation. The evaluation targeted some data quality dimensions like completeness, consistency.

9d75cc322a4e06d0a3a868cb91b04219a289c12c;Machine Learning: An Applied Econometric Approach;Machines are increasingly doing “intelligent” things. Face recognition algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function that predicts the presence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: How do these new empirical tools fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Machine learning not only provides new tools, it solves a different problem. Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation. So applying machine learning to economics requires finding relevant tasks. Machine learning algorithms are now technically easy to use: you can download convenient packages in R or Python. This also raises the risk that the algorithms are applied naively or;['2062143', '47281276'];['S.

0bc6977f2c260eb279a7e6feab34910434de210d;Cost Minimization for Big Data Processing in Geo-Distributed Data Centres;Demand on big data is being increasing day by day and also increasing heavy burden on computation, storage and communication in data centres, which lead to considerable expenditure to data centre providers. So, cost minimization became an issue for the upcoming big data. One of the main feature of big data is coupling of data and computation as computation task. This can be done only when that corresponding is available for computation. Three tasks like data placement, task assignment and data movement influence the expense of data centres. In this paper we study how to minimize cost through joint optimization of these above three factors for big data service in geo distributes data centres. Here we propose 2-D Markov chain to describe time to complete a particular task with consideration of data transmission and computation to derive average task completion time in closed time.

Of course, we are reluctant to give up the advantages of speedy and convenient computerized information. We appreciate the easy access to computerized data when making reservations, using automatic teller machines, buying new products on the web, or investigating topics in computer data bases.

One common aim of these strategies is to achieve smart manufacturing, which demands the interoperation, integration, and fusion of the physical world and the cyber world of manufacturing. As well, New IT [such as Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, mobile Internet, and cyber-physical systems (CPS)] have played pivotal roles in promoting smart manufacturing. Data generated in the physical world can be sensed and transfered to the cyber world through IoT and the Internet, and be processed and analyzed by cloud computing, big data technologies to adjust the physical world. The physical world and the cyber world of manufacturing are integrated based on CPS. On the other hand, servitization has become a prominent;['50556355', '29011153'];['F.

98ec4a0080f897c7ba4b6840a7403b1eae2a55aa;A Survey on Supply Chain Security: Application Areas, Security Threats, and Solution Architectures;The rapid improvement in the global connectivity standards has escalated the level of trade taking place among different parties. Advanced communication standards are allowing the trade of all types of commodities and services. Furthermore, the goods and services developed in a particular region are transcending boundaries to enter into foreign markets. Supply chains play an essential role in the trade of these goods. To be able to realize a connected world with no boundary restrictions in terms of goods and services, it is imperative to keep the associated supply chains transparent, secure, and trustworthy. Therefore, some fundamental changes in the current supply chain architecture are essential to achieve a secure trade environment. This article discusses the supply chain’s security-critical application areas and presents a detailed survey of the security issues in the existing supply chain architecture. Various emerging technologies, such as blockchain, machine learning (ML), and physically unclonable functions (PUFs);['150331642', '3185174', '1387789559', '2116998261', '2554658'];['Vikas Hassija', 'V.

We use three themes to connect insights from social and behavioral sciences: people’s uncertainty about the consequences of privacy-related behaviors and their own preferences over those consequences; the context-dependence of people’s concern, or lack thereof, about privacy; and the degree to which privacy concerns are malleable—manipulable by commercial and governmental interests. Organizing our discussion by these themes, we offer observations concerning the role of public policy in the protection of privacy in the information age.";['1683053', '2856650', '3070352'];['Alessandro Acquisti', 'L.

In particular, the research in omics sciences is moving from a hypothesis-driven to a data-driven approach. Healthcare is additionally always asking for a tighter integration with biomedical data in order to promote personalized medicine and to provide better treatments. Efficient analysis and interpretation of Big Data opens new avenues to explore molecular biology, new questions to ask about physiological and pathological states, and new ways to answer these open issues. Such analyses lead to better understanding of diseases and development of better and personalized diagnostics and therapeutics. However, such progresses are directly related to the availability of new solutions to deal with this huge amount of information.

Using detailed survey data on the business practices and information technology investments of 179 large publicly traded firms, we find that firms that adopt DDD have output and productivity that is 5-6% higher than what would be expected given their other investments and information technology usage. Furthermore, the relationship between DDD and performance also appears in other performance measures such as asset utilization, return on equity and market value. Using instrumental variables methods, we find evidence that the effect of DDD on the productivity do not appear to be due to reverse causality.

They have already led to entirely new classes of goods and services, many of which have been embraced enthusiastically by institutions and individuals alike. And yet, where these data commit to record details about human behavior, they have been perceived as a threat to fundamental values, including everything from autonomy, to fairness, justice, due process, property, solidarity, and, perhaps most of all, privacy. Given this apparent conflict, some have taken to calling for outright prohibitions on various big data practices, while others have found good reason to finally throw caution (and privacy) to the wind in the belief that big data will more than compensate for its potential costs.

4f55d6d95090c46b65d40ca3ea027d6113a381d6;SeqKit: A Cross-Platform and Ultrafast Toolkit for FASTA/Q File Manipulation;FASTA and FASTQ are basic and ubiquitous formats for storing nucleotide and protein sequences. Common manipulations of FASTA/Q file include converting, searching, filtering, deduplication, splitting, shuffling, and sampling. Existing tools only implement some of these manipulations, and not particularly efficiently, and some are only available for certain operating systems. Furthermore, the complicated installation process of required packages and running environments can render these programs less user friendly. This paper describes a cross-platform ultrafast comprehensive toolkit for FASTA/Q processing. SeqKit provides executable binary files for all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX, and can be directly used without any dependencies or pre-configurations. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar tools. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations.

They combine nonexperimental variation in local regulation of offline alcohol advertising with data from field tests that randomized exposure to online advertising for 275 different online advertising campaigns to 61,580 people. The results show that people are 8% less likely to say that they will purchase an alcoholic beverage in states that have alcohol advertising bans compared with states that do not. For consumers exposed to online advertising, this gap narrows to 3%. There are similar effects for four changes in local offline alcohol advertising restrictions when advertising effectiveness is observed both before and after the change. The effect of online advertising is disproportionately high for new products and for products with low awareness in places that have bans.

Big data can come with big differences. Some say that the 'three Vs' of big data should more properly be tagged as the 'three HVs': high-volume, high-variety, high-velocity, and high-veracity. Apply those tags to the mountains of information posted on social network and blogging sites, including Facebook, Twitter and VouTube; the deluge of text contained in email and instant messages; not to mention audio and video files.

This book claims that what people really care about when they complain and protest that privacy has been violated is not the act of sharing information itselfmost people understand that this is crucial to social life but the inappropriate, improper sharing of information. Arguing that privacy concerns should not be limited solely to concern about control over personal information, Helen Nissenbaum counters that information ought to be distributed and protected according to norms governing distinct social contextswhether it be workplace, health care, schools, or among family and friends. She warns that basic distinctions between public and private, informing many current privacy policies, in fact obscure more than they clarify. In truth, contemporary information systems should alarm us only when they function without regard for social norms and values, and thereby weaken the fabric of social;['2994505'];['H.

The basic idea is using an observational study to emulate a hypothetical randomised trial by comparing initiators versus non-initiators of treatment. After adjustment for measured baseline confounders, one can then conduct the observational analogue of an intention-to-treat analysis. We also explain two approaches to conduct the analogues of per-protocol and as-treated analyses after further adjusting for measured time-varying confounding and selection bias using inverse-probability weighting. As an example, we implemented these methods to estimate the effect of statins for primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) using data from electronic medical records in the UK. Despite strong confounding by indication, our approach detected a potential benefit of statin therapy. The analogue of the intention-to-treat hazard ratio (HR) of CHD was 0.89 (0.73, 1.09) for statin initiators versus non-initiators. The HR of CHD was 0.84 (0.54, 1.30) in the per-protocol;['5670460', '2113259011', '5351445', '145606484', '40362338'];['G. Danaei', 'Luis A. García Rodríguez', 'O. Cantero', 'R. Logan', 'M.

However, its random nature makes the synthesized data and even imbalanced classification results unstable. It means that in case of running SMOTE n different times, n different synthesized in-stances are obtained with n different classification results. To address this problem, we adapt the SMOTE idea in deep learning architecture. In this method, a deep neural network regression model is used to train the inputs and outputs of traditional SMOTE. Inputs of the proposed deep regression model are two randomly chosen data points which are concatenated to form a double size vector. The outputs of this model are corresponding randomly interpolated data points between two randomly chosen vectors with original dimension. The experimental results show that, Deep SMOTE can outperform traditional SMOTE in terms of precision, F1 score and Area Under Curve (AUC) in majority of test cases.;['3358806', '153780621'];['Hadi Mansourifar', 'W.

8016a1c3b31a05eb229ae0df8ddf5e58784da6c1;Efficient Skyline Computation on Big Data;Skyline is an important operation in many applications to return a set of interesting points from a potentially huge data space. Given a table, the operation finds all tuples that are not dominated by any other tuples. It is found that the existing algorithms cannot process skyline on big data efficiently. This paper presents a novel skyline algorithm SSPL on big data. SSPL utilizes sorted positional index lists which require low space overhead to reduce I/O cost significantly. The sorted positional index list Lj is constructed for each attribute Aj and is arranged in ascending order of Aj. SSPL consists of two phases. In phase 1, SSPL computes scan depth of the involved sorted positional index lists. During retrieving the lists in a round-robin fashion, SSPL performs pruning on any candidate positional index to discard the candidate whose corresponding tuple is not skyline result. Phase 1 ends when there is;['2625486', '145323381', '2711858', '49606486'];['Xixian Han', 'Jianzhong Li', 'Donghua Yang', 'Jinbao Wang'];;;;;;;dub6lule;IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering;2013.0;25;['Computer Science', 'Big Data'];['88087bd6b61eeb44148041ab4d1939b65f89e73b']

37b71e6a43e65a9f2c9701e5079d6ad81186fd6a;Elicitation of Candidate Subspaces in High-Dimensional Data;Anomaly detection is an important research area in data mining and has been studied intensively in recent years. The increasing number of features, non-informative noises and other irrelevant features, makes it challenging to detect anomalies in high-dimensional data. When analyzing high-dimensional data, anomalies are difficult to identify due to the sparsity caused by the curse of dimensionality. One most commonly used algorithm for reducing dimensionality is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), however, it is known to be sensitive in identifying anomalies. Furthermore, anomalies are rare and only can be found in low-dimensional subspaces. To effectively find anomalies in the high-dimensional space, we propose a technique that explores locally relevant and low-dimensional subspaces where anomalies may be possibly hidden due to the sparsity caused by the curse of dimensionality, and we call these subspaces as candidate subspaces for anomalies. In particular, the proposed technique integrates a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and PCA,;['8803433', '1729840', '38152929', '1490967734'];['Srikanth Thudumu', 'P.

69bb2581d27a810f4e64260f07cdf8c61a622665;Convolutional Neural Networks on Apache Storm;the performance of deep learning largely depends on the size of data. One data source is real-time streaming data, produced from mobile devices, sensors or social media, etc. Streaming data is high-speed and large-scale, which needs real-time processing. However, current mainstream frameworks are mainly designed for off-line data. To suit this, we first propose a deep learning framework based on Apache Storm, which is a distributed stream processing frame, fast and fault-tolerant. Our framework implements the distributed training of CNNs. which is different from MMLSpark or TensorFlowOnSpark that is a pure Java implementation. The design of message passing and synchronization is also suitable to other MapReduce-family distributed computing platforms. To validate our work, MNIST and Cifar -10 datasets are used for evaluation and comparison with similar architectures.

Fog computing can address those problems by providing elastic resources and services to end users at the edge of network, while cloud computing are more about providing resources distributed in the core network. This survey discusses the definition of fog computing and similar concepts, introduces representative application scenarios, and identifies various aspects of issues we may encounter when designing and implementing fog computing systems. It also highlights some opportunities and challenges, as direction of potential future work, in related techniques that need to be considered in the context of fog computing.;['1969902', '2133092949', '2042834297'];['Shanhe Yi', 'Cheng Li', 'Qun A.

To address these issues, in this paper we consider a setting where multiple tasks are geographically located in different places, where one task can synchronize data with others to leverage knowledge of related tasks. Specifically, we propose an adaptive primal-dual algorithm, which not only captures task-specific noise in adversarial learning but also carries out a projection-free update with runtime efficiency. Moreover, our model is well-suited to decentralized periodic-connected tasks as it allows the energy-starved or bandwidth-constraint tasks to postpone the update. Theoretical results demonstrate the convergence guarantee of our distributed algorithm with an optimal regret. Empirical results confirm that the proposed model is highly effective on various real-world datasets.";['2119185448', '2420746'];['Peng Yang', 'P.

Social-networking websites, e-mail, instant messaging, telephone, and VoIP are all technologies steeped in network data—data relating one person to another. Network data shifts the locus of information control away from individuals, as the individual's traditional and absolute discretion is replaced by that of his social-network. Our research demonstrates a method for accurately predicting the sexual orientation of Facebook users by analyzing friendship associations. After analyzing 4,080 Facebook profiles from the MIT network, we determined that the percentage of a given user's friends who self-identify as gay male is strongly correlated with the sexual orientation of that user, and we developed a logistic regression classifier with strong predictive power. Although we studied Facebook friendship ties, network data is pervasive in the broader context of computer-mediated communication, raising significant privacy issues for;['50112480', '145624789'];['C.

c663bbbefed5d9a89ef8d66e56f32576cee37fe6;Neural-Network-Based Models for Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting Using a Hybrid Exponential Smoothing and Levenberg–Marquardt Algorithm;This paper proposes a novel neural network (NN) training method that employs the hybrid exponential smoothing method and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, which aims to improve the generalization capabilities of previously used methods for training NNs for short-term traffic flow forecasting. The approach uses exponential smoothing to preprocess traffic flow data by removing the lumpiness from collected traffic flow data, before employing a variant of the LM algorithm to train the NN weights of an NN model. This approach aids NN training, as the preprocessed traffic flow data are more smooth and continuous than the original unprocessed traffic flow data. The proposed method was evaluated by forecasting short-term traffic flow conditions on the Mitchell freeway in Western Australia. With regard to the generalization capabilities for short-term traffic flow forecasting, the NN models developed using the proposed approach outperform those that are developed based on the alternative tested algorithms, which are;['10939631', '144306547', '5082281', '2288545212'];['Kit Yan Chan', 'T.

There are no completed randomized controlled trials of screening colonoscopies to date, and ongoing trials exclude subjects aged 75 years or older. Medicare, however, reimburses screening colonoscopies without upper age limit since 2001. We use over a decade experience of Medicare beneficiaries to evaluate the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy to prevent CRC in individuals aged 70-74 and 75-79. Methods: We performed a large-scale, population-based study emulating the design of a clinical trial including Medicare beneficiaries from years 2004-2012. We evaluate the effect of screening colonoscopy versus no screening on 8-year risk of CRC, stage at diagnosis and 30-day risk of adverse events. Results: We included 1,891,671 Medicare beneficiaries. In the 70-74 age group, the 8-year risk of CRC (95% CI) was 2.22% (2.03, 2.41) in the colonoscopy screening arm and 2.67% (2.62, 2.72) in the no screening arm;";['1398837771', '2072740070', '4763991', '40362338'];['X.

Accordingly, to address the problem of low accuracy, a multiscale fast correlation filtering tracking algorithm based on a feature fusion model is proposed in the present work with the aim of reducing the poor tracking effects caused by occlusion discrimination and scale changes in complex scenes. The object's grayscale (GRAY) feature, histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) feature, and color name (CN) feature are reduced to dimensions and fused to form a feature matrix.

c847e7a0430a475caf7173cafb02cab9367779b8;Robust Intelligent Malware Detection Using Deep Learning;Security breaches due to attacks by malicious software (malware) continue to escalate posing a major security concern in this digital age. With many computer users, corporations, and governments affected due to an exponential growth in malware attacks, malware detection continues to be a hot research topic. Current malware detection solutions that adopt the static and dynamic analysis of malware signatures and behavior patterns are time consuming and have proven to be ineffective in identifying unknown malwares in real-time. Recent malwares use polymorphic, metamorphic, and other evasive techniques to change the malware behaviors quickly and to generate a large number of new malwares. Such new malwares are predominantly variants of existing malwares, and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are being employed recently to conduct an effective malware analysis. However, such approaches are time consuming as they require extensive feature engineering, feature learning, and feature representation. By using the advanced MLAs such as;['51162051', '2474250', '2285465435', '2916235', '2285712617'];['R. Vinayakumar', 'M. Alazab', 'I. K. P. S. Senior Member', 'P.

The ViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with fixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers to model their global relation for classification. However, ViT achieves inferior performance to CNNs when trained from scratch on a midsize dataset like ImageNet. We find it is because: 1) the simple tokenization of input images fails to model the important local structure such as edges and lines among neighboring pixels, leading to low training sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone design of ViT leads to limited feature richness for fixed computation budgets and limited training samples. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new Tokens-To-Token Vision Transformer (T2T-VTT), which incorporates 1) a layer-wise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively structurize the image to tokens by recursively";['2087091296', '2144861793', None, '23476952', '145356288', '40983412', '33221685', '143653681'];['Li Yuan', 'Yunpeng Chen', 'Tao Wang', 'Weihao Yu', 'Yujun Shi', 'Francis E.

Specifically, we wanted to study the imperative of Facebook to monetize social relationships, what happens when one of our significant forms of communication is driven by the search for profit, by the logic of capital. We therefore wanted to ‘get inside’ and understand what capital's new lines of flight, informationally driven models of economic expansion, do to social relations. Taking up the challenge to develop methods appropriate to the challenges of ‘big data', we applied four different methods to investigate the interface that is Facebook: we designed custom software tools, generated an online survey, developed data visualizations, and conducted interviews with participants to discuss their understandings of our analysis.

The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k- anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected.

Contrary to conventional approaches to AI where tasks are solved from scratch using a fixed learning algorithm, meta-learning aims to improve the learning algorithm itself, given the experience of multiple learning episodes. This paradigm provides an opportunity to tackle many conventional challenges of deep learning, including data and computation bottlenecks, as well as generalization. This survey describes the contemporary meta-learning landscape. We first discuss definitions of meta-learning and position it with respect to related fields, such as transfer learning and hyperparameter optimization. We then propose a new taxonomy that provides a more comprehensive breakdown of the space of meta-learning methods today. We survey promising applications and successes of meta-learning such as few-shot learning and reinforcement learning.

Clinical coronary heart disease (CHD) occurred in 257 men during a follow-up period of eight and one-half years. Coronary heart disease risk is predicted using the additive multiple logistic model with the risk factors: age, cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, hematocrit, ECG status, smoking at intake, and relative body weight. The predicted individual CHD risk levels, using the logistic results derived from the WCGS data, are highly correlated with predicted risk levels using a Framingham study (FS) equation for these same risk factors with 12-year follow-up. The observed number of CHD events in the WCGS is not significantly different from the expected number of events derived from the FS logistic equation, after correction for length of follow-up.Multiple logistic analysis;['3002410', '2604418', '4532457', '2166761'];['R.

86366fef19e42747cd71b72a3015b874f756ed96;Anomaly Proposal-Based Fire Detection for Cyber-Physical Systems;Real-time fire detection systems are important and complex examples of Cyber-Physical Systems can be developed to optimize an escape route in an emergency for humans, with respect to the distance to exits. Various fire detection techniques have been introduced including traditional sensor detection to advanced deep learning-based techniques. However, only a handful of deep learning-based approaches aim to address real-time fire detection, and fire perception inefficiency should be crucial for early detection of fire. In this paper, a multi-stage architecture is proposed with two modules - a convolutional autoencoder module to extract anomaly region proposals and a convolutional neural network classifier to select the region proposals. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed architecture are confirmed experimentally. By focusing more on surveillance cameras, the presented system is suitable for a real-time fire detection system.;['1471729143', '2849644', '2113310369'];['Dilanga L. B.

595cb1395e5e4bfc9a879c90378bd7bcd697d4b8;Smart Brushing for Parallel Coordinates;The Parallel Coordinates plot is a popular tool for the visualization of high-dimensional data. One of the main challenges when using parallel coordinates is occlusion and overplotting resulting from large data sets. Brushing is a popular approach to address these challenges. Since its conception, limited improvements have been made to brushing both in the form of visual design and functional interaction. We present a set of novel, smart brushing techniques that enhance the standard interactive brushing of a parallel coordinates plot. We introduce two new interaction concepts: Higher-order, sketch-based brushing, and smart, data-driven brushing. Higher-order brushes support interactive, flexible, n-dimensional pattern searches involving an arbitrary number of dimensions. Smart, data-driven brushing provides interactive, real-time guidance to the user during the brushing process based on derived meta-data. In addition, we implement a selection of novel enhancements and user options that complement the two techniques as well as enhance the exploration and;['31798161', '1703037', '1400224411', '144473945', '1403449200'];"['Richard C.

However, building a speech recognition system for code-switching remains difficult due to the availability of limited resources and the expense and significant effort required to collect mixed-language data. We therefore propose a new learning method, meta-transfer learning, to transfer learn on a code-switched speech recognition system in a low-resource setting by judiciously extracting information from high-resource monolingual datasets. Our model learns to recognize individual languages, and transfer them so as to better recognize mixed-language speech by conditioning the optimization on the code-switching data. Based on experimental results, our model outperforms existing baselines on speech recognition and language modeling tasks, and is faster to converge.;['9162688', '66986482', '100466830', '152613855', '145011005', '40539650'];['Genta Indra Winata', 'Samuel Cahyawijaya', 'Zhaojiang Lin', 'Zihan Liu', 'Peng Xu', 'Pascale Fung'];1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44;Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics;conference;7;2020.0;London;;;;;['Engineering', 'Computer Science'];['020bb2ba5f3923858cd6882ba5c5a44ea8041ab6']

In this paper, Machine Learning (ML)-based hybrid Spectrum Sensing (SS) scheme is proposed. The scattering of the Test Statistics (TSs) of two detectors is used in the learning and prediction phases. As the SS decision is binary, the proposed scheme requires the learning of only the boundaries of H0-class in order to make a decision on the PU status: active or idle. Thus, a set of data generated under H0 hypothesis is used to train the detection system. Accordingly, unlike the existing ML-based schemes of the literature, no PU statistical parameters are required. In order to discriminate between H0-class and elsewhere, we used a one-class classification approach that is inspired by the Isolation Forest algorithm.

befe585e679c7fdf2f9df84b87fcbdc289bb14b2;Fog Computing Approaches in Smart Cities: A State-of-the-Art Review;These days, the development of smart cities, specifically in location-aware, latency-sensitive, and security-crucial applications (such as emergency fire events, patient health monitoring, or real-time manufacturing) heavily depends on a more advance computing paradigms that can address these requirements. In this regard, fog computing, a robust cloud computing complement, plays a preponderant role by virtue of locating closer to the end-devices. Nonetheless, utilized approaches in smart cities are frequently cloud-based, which causes not only the security and time-sensitive services to suffer but also its flexibility and reliability to be restricted. So as to obviate the limitations of cloud and other related computing paradigms such as edge computing, this paper proposes a systematic literature review (SLR) for the state-of-the-art fog-based approaches in smart cities. Furthermore, according to the content of the reviewed researches, a taxonomy is proposed, falls into three classes, including service-based, resource-based, and application-based. This SLR also investigates the evaluation;['1511018741', '31226742', '2064174278', '51506402'];['Maryam Songhorabadi', 'M. Rahimi', 'Amir Mahdi Moghaddam Farid', 'M. H.

Indeed, design and planning an integrated CLSC in real-world volatile markets is an important and necessary issue. Further, risk-neutral approaches, which are considered expected values, are not efficient for such uncertain conditions. Hence, this paper, copes with the design and planning problem of a CLSC in a two-stage stochastic structure. Besides, risk criteria are considered through using three types of popular and well-behaved risk measures: mean absolute deviation, value at risk and conditional value at risk (CVaR). Consequently, three types of mean-risk models are developed as objective functions and decision-making procedures are undertaken based on the expected values and risk adversity criteria.

Technologies like IoT, trends in social media and the capabilities of smart-phones are producing and digitizing lots of data that was previously unavailable. This massive increase of data creates opportunities to gain new business models, but also demands new techniques and methods of data quality in knowledge discovery, especially when the data comes from different sources (e.g., sensors, social networks, cameras, etc.). The data quality process of the data set proposes conclusions about the information they contain. This is increasingly done with the aid of data cleaning approaches. Therefore, guaranteeing a high data quality is considered as the primary goal of the data scientist. In this paper, we propose a process for data cleaning in regression models (DC-RM).

e775e649d815a02373eac840cf5e33a04ff85c95;CvT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers;We present in this paper a new architecture, named Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision Transformer (ViT) in performance and efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both de-signs. This is accomplished through two primary modifications: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding, and a convolutional Transformer block leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes introduce desirable properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the ViT architecture (i.e. shift, scale, and distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of Transformers (i.e. dynamic attention, global context, and better generalization). We validate CvT by conducting extensive experiments, showing that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transformers and ResNets on ImageNet-1k, with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs. In addition, performance gains are maintained when pretrained on larger datasets (e.g. ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pretrained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of;['2119019500', '2054421528', '40589056', '2152968847', '3386593', '145347147', '2152828578'];['Haiping Wu', 'Bin Xiao', 'N.

This model should avoid the overfitting and underfitting of data, and achieve a low generalization error that characterizes its prediction performance. In order to identify such a model, one needs to decide which model to select from candidate model families based on performance evaluations. In this paper, we review the theoretical framework of model selection and model assessment, including error-complexity curves, the bias-variance tradeoff, and learning curves for evaluating statistical models. We discuss criterion-based, step-wise selection procedures and resampling methods for model selection, whereas cross-validation provides the most simple and generic means for computationally estimating all required entities. To make the theoretical concepts transparent, we present worked examples for linear regression models. However, our conceptual presentation is extensible to more general models, as well as classification problems.;['1399003993', '1792351'];['F. Emmert-Streib', 'M. Dehmer'];;;;;;;gi5fod16;Mach. Learn.

Each stakeholder maintains data about food products that they handle, but this data is not transparently available to all other stakeholders in the chain due to various reasons. Trust and reciprocity for data sharing is limited and there is insufficient clarity in data ownership and possible legal consequences. However, various stakeholders could benefit from making data available across the supply chain. Food producers are very interested in consumer demands and trends. Growers also want to guide their supply based on the potential demand for specific food products in the near future.

As cancer rates increase, there is a concomitant increase in adverse correlates, such as cognitive impairment and depressive symptomatology. In order to develop appropriate interventions, it is vital to assess relationships among cancer, depressive symptoms and cognitive functioning. Methods: The sample consisted of 403 older adults with cancer diagnoses from the Health and Retirement Study. Using latent class growth analysis, longitudinal data were explored. The goals were to investigate trajectories of cognitive functioning, and to identify whether depressive symptoms and demographic factors predicted membership in the cognitive classes. Results: Three classes of cognitive functioning best fit the data: High, Middle and Low Recall, fairly stable trajectories from pre-diagnosis to a period four years after diagnosis. More depressive symptoms after diagnosis (but not prior) significantly predicted membership in the Low Recall class. Depressive symptoms;['7993589', '5296252'];['R. Morin', 'E.

2a04610f48bb448953348c4b1087fc9c201a01f8;Market Efficiency in the Age of Big Data;Modern investors face a high-dimensional prediction problem: thousands of observable variables are potentially relevant for forecasting. We reassess the conventional wisdom on market efficiency in light of this fact. In our model economy, which resembles a typical machine learning setting, N assets have cash flows that are a linear function of J firm characteristics, but with uncertain coefficients. Risk-neutral Bayesian investors impose shrinkage (ridge regression) or sparsity (Lasso) when they estimate the J coefficients of the model and use them to price assets. When J is comparable in size to N, returns appear cross-sectionally predictable using firm characteristics to an econometrician who analyzes data from the economy ex post. A factor zoo emerges even without p-hacking and data-mining. Standard in-sample tests of market efficiency reject the no-predictability null with high probability, despite the fact that investors optimally use the information available to them in real time.

Their hard inductive biases enable sample-efficient learning, but come at the cost of a potentially lower performance ceiling. Vision transformers rely on more flexible self-attention layers, and have recently outperformed CNNs for image classification. However, they require costly pre-training on large external datasets or distillation from pre-trained convolutional networks. In this paper, we ask the following question: is it possible to combine the strengths of these two architectures while avoiding their respective limitations? To this end, we introduce gated positional self-attention (GPSA), a form of positional self-attention which can be equipped with a ‘soft’ convolutional inductive bias. We initialize the GPSA layers to mimic the locality of convolutional layers, then give each attention head the freedom to escape locality by adjusting a gating parameter regulating the attention paid to position versus content information.

On a political level, such proposals threaten powerful data processing interests. On a theoretical level, data processors and other data privacy opponents argue that imposing restrictions on the collection, use, and exchange of personal data would ignore established understandings of property, limit individual freedom of choice, violate principles of rational information use, and infringe data processors' freedom of speech. In this article, Professor Julie Cohen explores these theoretical challenges to informational privacy protection. She concludes that categorical arguments from property, choice, truth, and speech lack weight, and mask fundamentally political choices about the allocation of power over information, cost, and opportunity. Each debate, although couched in a rhetoric of individual liberty, effectively reduces individuals to objects of choices and trades made by others. Professor Cohen argues, instead, that the debate about data privacy protection should be grounded in;['34806564'];['Julie E.

We estimated the world’s technological capacity to store, communicate, and compute information, tracking 60 analog and digital technologies during the period from 1986 to 2007. In 2007, humankind was able to store 2.9 × 1020 optimally compressed bytes, communicate almost 2 × 1021 bytes, and carry out 6.4 × 1018 instructions per second on general-purpose computers. General-purpose computing capacity grew at an annual rate of 58%. The world’s capacity for bidirectional telecommunication grew at 28% per year, closely followed by the increase in globally stored information (23%). Humankind’s capacity for unidirectional information diffusion through broadcasting channels has experienced comparatively modest annual growth (6%). Telecommunication has been dominated by digital technologies since 1990 (99.9% in digital format in 2007), and the majority of our technological memory has been in digital format since;['144212002', '37162464'];['Martin Hilbert', 'P.

5a6d393d96d9fc1e4070c374a34cf7eec1366f5f;Twitter Spam Detection: A Systematic Review;Nowadays, with the rise of Internet access and mobile devices around the globe, more people are using social networks for collaboration and receiving real-time information. Twitter, the microblogging that is becoming a critical source of communication and news propagation, has grabbed the attention of spammers to distract users. So far, researchers have introduced various defense techniques to detect spams and combat spammer activities on Twitter. To overcome this problem, in recent years, many novel techniques have been offered by researchers, which have greatly enhanced the spam detection performance. Therefore, it raises a motivation to conduct a systematic review about different approaches of spam detection on Twitter. This review focuses on comparing the existing research techniques on Twitter spam detection systematically. Literature review analysis reveals that most of the existing methods rely on Machine Learning-based algorithms. Among these Machine Learning algorithms, the major differences are related to various feature selection methods.;['2029500620', '51506402', '2056137945', '2719926'];['Sepideh Bazzaz Abkenar', 'M. H.

Above all, from the beginning of the new millennium, scholars and practitioners have paid an increasing attention to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in operational processes management and challenges for new business models, in a sustainable and socially responsible perspective. Thus, the stakeholders can assume a proactive or marginal role in the value creation for business, according to their own environmental awareness. These issues appear still “open” in some industries, such as the agri-food system, where the adoption of new technologies requires rethinking and redesigning the whole business model. Methodologically, we brought forward an in-depth review of the literature about major articles in this field.

505b2f4f5364ec43657c13932b334b6f1f3fc7a8;Investigating the Value of Sociomaterialism in Conceptualizing IT Capability of a Firm;Sociomateriality (or sociomaterialism) allows us to approach the information technology (IT) capability research from an angle that has been rarely visited by information systems scholars. While relevant studies presume that humans and materials are distinct and largely independent, sociomateriality emphasizes agency that represents the relational, emergent, and shifting capacity realized through the association of actors (both humans and materials). The objective of this paper is to explore the value of conducting IT capability research through the theoretical lens of sociomaterialism. For this, we expand the imbrication metaphor introduced in an early study to explain the formation and advancement of a firm's IT capability from the sociomaterial perspective. Then, the key building blocks of IT capability of an organization are conceptualized based on the combination of existing studies and the expanded imbrication metaphor. Lastly, the effectiveness of formulating IT capability as a third-order construct that substantiates the entanglement concept of sociomaterialism;['2475083', '2762149', '1931201'];['G.

bfc1c08ba71294ce5de5e131561cfa7594d64a0f;Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior;We show that easily accessible digital records of behavior, Facebook Likes, can be used to automatically and accurately predict a range of highly sensitive personal attributes including: sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender. The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88% of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95% of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85% of cases.

f0251eca32833ffe9fc0e578edf7d4a4832ac7bb;A hybrid classification method for Twitter spam detection based on differential evolution and random forest;Social networking services are online platforms that are distributed across different computers over long distances. Twitter is the most popular microblogging site that allows users to share their opinions and real‐world events. Due to its popularity and ease of use, Twitter has also attracted spammers. As a result, spam detection is one of the most critical problems. In order to provide a spam‐free environment, it is necessary to identify and filter spam tweets as well as their owners. A hybrid method, which is based on Synthetic Minority Over‐sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) and Differential Evolution (DE) strategies, is presented to enhance the spam detection rate in real Twitter datasets. SMOTE is applied to tackle the imbalanced class distribution of datasets, while DE is used to tune Random Forest (RF) hyperparameters. Compared with related work and based on evaluation results, the presented method significantly enhances the classification performance in imbalanced datasets.

We build a single text graph for a corpus based on word co-occurrence and document word relations, then learn a Text Graph Convolutional Network (Text GCN) for the corpus.

Accurate, timely diagnosis enables early VAP patients to receive appropriate therapies and reduce the occurrence of complication. However, so far clinical datas regarding the epidemiology and mortality of VAP are still limited. Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database is a free, open and public resource about ICU research database. MIMIC database is a free, open, public database that collects information on more than 40,000 ICU patients who are predominantly white people. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to observe and describe the clinical characteristics of VAP patients in ICU from the MIMIC database.

Facebook currently stores over 260 billion images, which translates to over 20 petabytes of data. Users upload one billion new photos (∼60 terabytes) each week and Facebook serves over one million images per second at peak. Haystack provides a less expensive and higher performing solution than our previous approach, which leveraged network attached storage appliances over NFS. Our key observation is that this traditional design incurs an excessive number of disk operations because of metadata lookups. We carefully reduce this per photo metadata so that Haystack storage machines can perform all metadata lookups in main memory. This choice conserves disk operations for reading actual data and thus increases overall throughput.;['49250814', '2145349829', '2144397535', '46683595', '2499922'];['D.

However, pure Transformer architectures often require a large amount of training data or extra supervision to obtain comparable performance with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To overcome these limitations, we analyze the potential drawbacks when directly borrowing Transformer architectures from NLP. Then we propose a new Convolution-enhanced image Transformer (CeiT) which combines the advantages of CNNs in extracting low-level features, strengthening locality, and the advantages of Transformers in establishing long-range dependencies. Three modifications are made to the original Transformer: 1) instead of the straightforward tokenization from raw input images, we design an Image-to-Tokens (I2T) module that extracts patches from generated low-level features; 2) the feed-froward network in each encoder block is replaced with a Locally-enhanced Feed-Forward (LeFF) layer that promotes the correlation among neighboring";['50492964', '2119111668', '2145253401', '9548994', '5237666', '2118256875'];['Kun Yuan', 'Shaopeng Guo', 'Ziwei Liu', 'Aojun Zhou', 'F.

It is thus desirable to develop effective presentation attack detection (PAD) methods. However, the unpredictable PAs make PAD be a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel One-Class PAD (OCPAD) method for Optical Coherence Technology (OCT) images based fingerprint PA detection. The proposed OCPAD model is learned from a training set only consists of Bonafides (i.e. real fingerprints). The reconstruction error and latent code obtained from the trained auto-encoder network in the proposed model is taken as the basis for the following spoofness score calculation. To get more accurate reconstruction error, we propose an activation map based weighting model to further refine the accuracy of reconstruction error. We test different statistics and distance measures and finally use a decision level fusion to make the final prediction.

Existing methods for indoor magnetic-based positioning are either point-based fingerprint matching or sequence-based fingerprint matching using the raw magnetic field strength. However, the magnetometers in smartphones are vulnerable to a few factors such as user’s postures and walking speed, which causes the magnetic field strength corresponding to a location often shift in time or exhibit local distortions, thus greatly limits the positioning performance of existing methods rely on raw magnetic field strength. To this end, we observe the differences among magnetic field strength sequences are mainly attributed to small local segments, and design a new sequence-based fingerprint based on the differences among small local segments of raw MFS sequence to represent raw MFS sequence for indoor positioning.

We define the architecture of SCA as the integration of three sets of resources, data management resources (DMR), IT-enabled planning resources and performance management resources (PMR), from the perspective of a resource-based view. Based on the data collected from 537 manufacturing plants, we test hypotheses exploring the relationships among these resources, supply chain planning satisfaction, and operational performance. Our analysis supports that DMR should be considered a key building block of manufacturers’ business analytics initiatives for supply chains. The value of data is transmitted to outcome values through increasing supply chain planning and performance capabilities. Additionally, the deployment of advanced IT-enabled planning resources occurs after acquisition of DMR.

However, the classification of such data is a challenging task due to their high dimensionality, noise, and heterogeneity. In recent years, deep learning classifiers generated much interest, but due to their complexity, so far, little is known about the utility of this method for genomics. In this paper, we address this problem by studying a computational diagnostics task by classification of breast cancer and inflammatory bowel disease patients based on high‐dimensional gene expression data. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the classification performance of deep belief networks (DBNs) in dependence on its multiple model parameters and in comparison with support vector machines (SVMs). Furthermore, we investigate combined classifiers that integrate DBNs with SVMs. Such a classifier utilizes a DBN as representation learner forming the input for a SVM.

Many studies on key enabling technologies for resource organization and system operation of blockchain-secured smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0 had been conducted. However, the progression and promotion of these blockchain applications have been fundamentally impeded by various issues in scalability, flexibility, and cybersecurity. This survey discusses how blockchain systems can overcome potential cybersecurity barriers to achieving intelligence in Industry 4.0. In this regard, eight cybersecurity issues (CIs) are identified in manufacturing systems. Ten metrics for implementing blockchain applications in the manufacturing system are devised while surveying research in blockchain-secured smart manufacturing. This study reveals how these CIs have been studied in the literature. Based on insights obtained from this analysis, future research directions for blockchain-secured smart manufacturing are presented, which potentially guides research on urgent cybersecurity concerns for achieving intelligence in Industry 4.0.;['144602334', '145200310', '2112580903', '46508848', '2146553512', '2149239106', '2075437225', '2116847188'];['Jiewu Leng', 'S.

528a5c6a07f3cd5dcff2d33382bbcf82cc709a71;Online Feature Selection with Streaming Features;We propose a new online feature selection framework for applications with streaming features where the knowledge of the full feature space is unknown in advance. We define streaming features as features that flow in one by one over time whereas the number of training examples remains fixed. This is in contrast with traditional online learning methods that only deal with sequentially added observations, with little attention being paid to streaming features. The critical challenges for Online Streaming Feature Selection (OSFS) include 1) the continuous growth of feature volumes over time, 2) a large feature space, possibly of unknown or infinite size, and 3) the unavailability of the entire feature set before learning starts. In the paper, we present a novel Online Streaming Feature Selection method to select strongly relevant and nonredundant features on the fly. An efficient Fast-OSFS algorithm is proposed to improve feature selection performance. The proposed algorithms are;['1748808', '46330674', '143911565', '48016595', '1694121'];['Xindong Wu', 'Kui Yu', 'W.

1d1bf83f34b7b192af837cc853adda60574a389e;IQ-TREE: A Fast and Effective Stochastic Algorithm for Estimating Maximum-Likelihood Phylogenies;Large phylogenomics data sets require fast tree inference methods, especially for maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies. Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2% and 87.1% of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in 75.7% and 47.1% of the DNA alignments and 42.2% and 100% of the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of obtaining higher likelihoods;['6765359', '96048871', '2540873', '2884127'];['Lam-Tung Nguyen', 'H. Schmidt', 'A. von Haeseler', 'B.

This paradigm assumes that better ImageNet architectures perform better on chest X-ray tasks and that ImageNet-pretrained weights provide a performance boost over random initialization. In this work, we compare the transfer performance and parameter efficiency of 16 popular convolutional architectures on a large chest X-ray dataset (CheXpert) to investigate these assumptions. First, we find no relationship between ImageNet performance and CheXpert performance for both models without pretraining and models with pretraining. Second, we find that, for models without pretraining, the choice of model family influences performance more than size within a family for medical imaging tasks. Third, we observe that ImageNet pretraining yields a statistically significant boost in performance across architectures, with a higher boost for smaller architectures. Fourth, we examine whether ImageNet architectures are unnecessarily large for CheXpert by truncating final blocks from pretrained;['2078911529', '2066276338', '2047009195', '34699434', '1453104568'];['Alexander Ke', 'William Ellsworth', 'Oishi Banerjee', 'A.

However, a data‐adaptive procedure may be able to better exploit information available in measured covariates. By combining predictions from multiple algorithms, ensemble learning offers an alternative to logistic regression modeling to further reduce bias in estimated marginal structural model parameters. We describe the application of two ensemble learning approaches to estimating stabilized weights: super learning (SL), an ensemble machine learning approach that relies on V‐fold cross validation, and an ensemble learner (EL) that creates a single partition of the data into training and validation sets. Longitudinal data from two multicenter cohort studies in Spain (CoRIS and CoRIS‐MD) were analyzed to estimate the mortality hazard ratio for initiation versus no initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy among HIV positive subjects. Both ensemble approaches produced hazard ratio estimates further away from the null, and with tighter confidence intervals,;['144505777', '145606484', '144341617', '145894733', '40362338'];['Susan Gruber', 'R.

We identified challenges that are specific for big data quality assessments with particular emphasis on their usage in smart ecosystems and make a proposal for a scalable cross-organizational approach that addresses these challenges.

f454f6b5f2ca9749ddf442eb5134612ef7f758c1;ResNet strikes back: An improved training procedure in timm;The influential Residual Networks designed by He et al. remain the gold-standard architecture in numerous scientific publications. They typically serve as the default architecture in studies, or as baselines when new architectures are proposed. Yet there has been significant progress on best practices for training neural networks since the inception of the ResNet architecture in 2015. Novel optimization&data-augmentation have increased the effectiveness of the training recipes. In this paper, we re-evaluate the performance of the vanilla ResNet-50 when trained with a procedure that integrates such advances. We share competitive training settings and pre-trained models in the timm open-source library, with the hope that they will serve as better baselines for future work. For instance, with our more demanding training setting, a vanilla ResNet-50 reaches 80.4% top-1 accuracy at resolution 224x224 on ImageNet-val without extra data or distillation.

7c4356ec0dca6e6df0af7a882e2cd1571c8bf3dc;Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Self-Predictive Representations;While deep reinforcement learning excels at solving tasks where large amounts of data can be collected through virtually unlimited interaction with the environment, learning from limited interaction remains a key challenge. We posit that an agent can learn more efficiently if we augment reward maximization with self-supervised objectives based on structure in its visual input and sequential interaction with the environment. Our method, Self-Predictive Representations(SPR), trains an agent to predict its own latent state representations multiple steps into the future. We compute target representations for future states using an encoder which is an exponential moving average of the agent's parameters and we make predictions using a learned transition model. On its own, this future prediction objective outperforms prior methods for sample-efficient deep RL from pixels. We further improve performance by adding data augmentation to the future prediction loss, which forces the agent's representations to be consistent across multiple views of;['51881243', '12679121', '46186660', '40482726', '1760871', '143902541'];['Max Schwarzer', 'Ankesh Anand', 'Rishab Goel', 'R.

7564f674658a4e8124c805d0beec6758bb13f540;Decisions Through Data: Analytics in Healthcare;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The amount of data in healthcare is increasing at an astonishing rate. However, in general, the industry has not deployed the level of data management and analysis necessary to make use of those data. As a result, healthcare executives face the risk of being overwhelmed by a flood of unusable data. In this essay I argue that, in order to extract actionable information, leaders must take advantage of the promise of data analytics. Small data, predictive modeling expansion, and real‐time analytics are three forms of data analytics. On the basis of my analysis for this study, I recommend all three for adoption. Recognizing the uniqueness of each organization's situation, I also suggest that practices, hospitals, and healthcare systems examine small data and conduct real‐time analytics and that large‐scale organizations managing populations of patients adopt predictive modeling. I found that all three solutions assist in the collection, management, and;['40421816'];['Mary J Wills'];;;;;;;vq43x17d;Journal of Healthcare Management;2014.0;59;['Medicine', 'Engineering', 'Analytics'];['91b63db746becca15090963a8990dfe2b5103799']
b3d8dffb73bc93de239998548386c84177caa2ad;Multi-digit Number Recognition from Street View Imagery using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks;Abstract: Recognizing arbitrary multi-character text in unconstrained natural photographs is a hard problem. In this paper, we address an equally hard sub-problem in this domain viz. recognizing arbitrary multi-digit numbers from Street View imagery. Traditional approaches to solve this problem typically separate out the localization, segmentation, and recognition steps. In this paper we propose a unified approach that integrates these three steps via the use of a deep convolutional neural network that operates directly on the image pixels. We employ the DistBelief implementation of deep neural networks in order to train large, distributed neural networks on high quality images. We find that the performance of this approach increases with the depth of the convolutional network, with the best performance occurring in the deepest architecture we trained, with eleven hidden layers. We evaluate this approach on the publicly available SVHN dataset and achieve over $96\%$ accuracy in recognizing complete street numbers.;['153440022', '2751422', '46920727', '1911894', '1961864'];['I.

afb1acd9cb0caa50b9b9170e3cd63fa4a6f65478;Client-Edge-Cloud Hierarchical Federated Learning;Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning framework to train a deep learning model without accessing clients’ private data. Previous works assume one central parameter server either at the cloud or at the edge. The cloud server can access more data but with excessive communication overhead and long latency, while the edge server enjoys more efficient communications with the clients. To combine their advantages, we propose a client-edge-cloud hierarchical Federated Learning system, supported with a HierFAVG algorithm that allows multiple edge servers to perform partial model aggregation. In this way, the model can be trained faster and better communication-computation trade-offs can be achieved. Convergence analysis is provided for HierFAVG and the effects of key parameters are also investigated, which lead to qualitative design guidelines. Empirical experiments verify the analysis and demonstrate the benefits of this hierarchical architecture in different data distribution scenarios.

Unlike existing point cloud completion networks, which generate the overall shape of the point cloud from the incomplete point cloud and always change existing points and encounter noise and geometrical loss, PF-Net preserves the spatial arrangements of the incomplete point cloud and can figure out the detailed geometrical structure of the missing region(s) in the prediction. To succeed at this task, PF-Net estimates the missing point cloud hierarchically by utilizing a feature-points-based multi-scale generating network. Further, we add up multi-stage completion loss and adversarial loss to generate more realistic missing region(s). The adversarial loss can better tackle multiple modes in the prediction. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for several challenging point cloud completion tasks.;['2109595473', '1390337950', '2305230695', '2060411257', '2052967041'];['Zitian Huang', 'Yikuan Yu', 'Jiawen Xu', 'Feng Ni', 'Xinyi Le'];768b87bb-8a18-4d9c-a161-4d483c776bcf;Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition;conference;9;2020.0;Beijing;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['9423aeaad6655d701a5ae56ebc18d224cb5a80bb', 'd8ba2965be9cc93439c5bb52961b504c39f16e80', 'a58715797b61588cbd020b9a98292a98f8483420', '32a69681c103807704f71b838454c7924ceec5ce', 'e2751a898867ce6687e08a5cc7bdb562e999b841', '21248bcc81539e7cd1ef83b3b184768603f6f247', 'a84906dbd4d6640f918d0b6ed2a7313dda0d55f1', '29c05c8a2f24ddf9572019b396801ad9bb21e884', '170e2f4778f975768aaa5e888349fc0cb23d576f', '510d98681e5e85fb1265513728f16e2543ae1b4b', '41edd975efbbc5af28971bc2669d9a1ae6ee8ace', '52afbe99de04878a5ac73a4adad4b1cedae8a6ce', 'd68fb3a66b4e64abffa22d32e98378b82f601cc7', '572a5aa00f0569887469ffb7554699c21156ba0b', '80f5ee8578ee76e2c17824f211762ffec7e029d4', 'b3159fd22e19e24d7cde9d37b3e482b832d4fa58', '8674494bd7a076286b905912d26d47f7501c4046', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba', '41d08fb733f3e50ac183490f84d6377dffccf350', '729d5c7dc6bfb32e47b5bd24cdb01ccaaf62bba5', '76cee11c6a9f1424f03571378a966c1417ff2935']
1a620e05f545f9e729e4e30adb035452af40e0dc;A Survey on End-Edge-Cloud Orchestrated Network Computing Paradigms;Sending data to the cloud for analysis was a prominent trend during the past decades, driving cloud computing as a dominant computing paradigm. However, the dramatically increasing number of devices and data traffic in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era are posing significant burdens on the capacity-limited Internet and uncontrollable service delay. It becomes difficult to meet the delay-sensitive and context-aware service requirements of IoT applications by using cloud computing alone. Facing these challenges, computing paradigms are shifting from the centralized cloud computing to distributed edge computing. Several new computing paradigms, including Transparent Computing, Mobile Edge Computing, Fog Computing, and Cloudlet, have emerged to leverage the distributed resources at network edge to provide timely and context-aware services. By integrating end devices, edge servers, and cloud, they form a hierarchical IoT architecture, i.e., End-Edge-Cloud orchestrated architecture to improve the performance of IoT systems.

The application services hosted under Cloud computing model have complex provisioning, composition, configuration, and deployment requirements. Evaluating the performance of Cloud provisioning policies, application workload models, and resources performance models in a repeatable manner under varying system and user configurations and requirements is difficult to achieve.

Inspired by BERT, we devise a Masked Point Modeling (MPM) task to pre-train point cloud Transformers. Specifically, we first divide a point cloud into several local point patches, and a point cloud Tokenizer with a discrete Variational AutoEncoder (dVAE) is designed to generate discrete point tokens containing meaningful local information. Then, we randomly mask out some patches of input point clouds and feed them into the backbone Transformers. The pre-training objective is to recover the original point tokens at the masked locations under the supervision of point tokens obtained by the Tokenizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BERT-style pre-training strategy significantly improves the performance of standard point cloud Transformers. Equipped with our pre-training strategy, we show that a pure Transformer architecture attains 93.8% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 83.1% accuracy;['2116329737', '145016965', '2052552620', '34097174', '48128428', '1697700'];['Xumin Yu', 'Lulu Tang', 'Yongming Rao', 'Tiejun Huang', 'Jie Zhou', 'Jiwen Lu'];768b87bb-8a18-4d9c-a161-4d483c776bcf;Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition;conference;10;2021.0;Los Angeles;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['9653c070724e44f023e8cc3ec79f0b9e6d59480d', '6351ebb4a3287f5f3e1273464b3b91e5df5a16d7', '8e4d635ab9620340128f96ae889bdb570bd5fef0', '80da612e1831b8c11539180871843cff6dfaac90', '722ad6ac92286507437b31486f47987d6ece05c9', 'fe3e55e6b6db8c127e5931e089b74982fd307964', 'db33c408174eef1e40661e8279afbbbf6db2352c', '6f870f7f02a8c59c3e23f407f3ef00dd1dcf8fc4', '2cd605106b88c85d7d8b865b1ef0f8c8293debf1', 'b7dfca646ac61ec85c8e015828a05c77f2d7d22f', 'ad7ddcc14984caae308c397f1a589aae75d4ab71', 'ff50b46b4e1cc0fd9beb832fc3468785b635a824', '268d347e8a55b5eb82fb5e7d2f800e33c75ab18a', '962dc29fdc3fbdc5930a10aba114050b82fe5a3e', 'b42b1ba256783184f714cc27ececbfb52e247f34', 'b2b0c31d036941cb557be4afb7101dc1b72f17cb', 'b227f3e4c0dc96e5ac5426b85485a70f2175a205', '49b0b43e57dc8efe3a92f06ddcb5a7f39da4790d', 'e1799aaf23c12af6932dc0ef3dfb1638f01413d1', '6400c36efdb8a66b401b6aef26c057227266fddd', '572a5aa00f0569887469ffb7554699c21156ba0b', '204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776', '8674494bd7a076286b905912d26d47f7501c4046', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba', '729d5c7dc6bfb32e47b5bd24cdb01ccaaf62bba5']

731304583d2e40bf6ee030e3cd81f767713f999a;CloneCloud: elastic execution between mobile device and cloud;Mobile applications are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and provide ever richer functionality on mobile devices. At the same time, such devices often enjoy strong connectivity with more powerful machines ranging from laptops and desktops to commercial clouds. This paper presents the design and implementation of CloneCloud, a system that automatically transforms mobile applications to benefit from the cloud. The system is a flexible application partitioner and execution runtime that enables unmodified mobile applications running in an application-level virtual machine to seamlessly off-load part of their execution from mobile devices onto device clones operating in a computational cloud. CloneCloud uses a combination of static analysis and dynamic profiling to partition applications automatically at a fine granularity while optimizing execution time and energy use for a target computation and communication environment. At runtime, the application partitioning is effected by migrating a thread from the mobile device at a chosen point to the clone;['1704157', '2937896', '2286904', '145835621', '1994583'];['Byung-Gon Chun', 'Sunghwan Ihm', 'Petros Maniatis', 'M.

b6cf10713451191de8f0d30211f85a1080249a74;TopNet: Structural Point Cloud Decoder;3D point cloud generation is of great use for 3D scene modeling and understanding. Real-world 3D object point clouds can be properly described by a collection of low-level and high-level structures such as surfaces, geometric primitives, semantic parts,etc. In fact, there exist many different representations of a 3D object point cloud as a set of point groups. Existing frameworks for point cloud genera-ion either do not consider structure in their proposed solutions, or assume and enforce a specific structure/topology,e.g. a collection of manifolds or surfaces, for the generated point cloud of a 3D object. In this work, we pro-pose a novel decoder that generates a structured point cloud without assuming any specific structure or topology on the underlying point set. Our decoder is softly constrained to generate a point cloud following a hierarchical rooted tree structure. We show that given enough capacity and allowing for redundancies, the proposed decoder is;['26917145', '13622184', '1387977754', '145950884', '1702137'];['Lyne P.

The new architecture performs multiplicative transformations and shares parameters of these transformations according to the subdivisions of the point clouds imposed onto them by kdtrees. Unlike the currently dominant convolutional architectures that usually require rasterization on uniform twodimensional or three-dimensional grids, Kd-networks do not rely on such grids in any way and therefore avoid poor scaling behavior. In a series of experiments with popular shape recognition benchmarks, Kd-networks demonstrate competitive performance in a number of shape recognition tasks such as shape classification, shape retrieval and shape part segmentation.;['10714572', '1740145'];['Roman Klokov', 'V.

c32fd8ea1b3f2df410410fb18d569dede102c53a;Diffusion Probabilistic Models for 3D Point Cloud Generation;We present a probabilistic model for point cloud generation, which is fundamental for various 3D vision tasks such as shape completion, upsampling, synthesis and data augmentation. Inspired by the diffusion process in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we view points in point clouds as particles in a thermodynamic system in contact with a heat bath, which diffuse from the original distribution to a noise distribution. Point cloud generation thus amounts to learning the reverse diffusion process that transforms the noise distribution to the distribution of a desired shape. Specifically, we propose to model the reverse diffusion process for point clouds as a Markov chain conditioned on certain shape latent. We derive the variational bound in closed form for training and provide implementations of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in point cloud generation and auto-encoding.

af2ad9cad35e99a9076b37176b92398a487e057d;Collaborative Cloud and Edge Computing for Latency Minimization;By performing data processing at the network edge, mobile edge computing can effectively overcome the deficiencies of network congestion and long latency in cloud computing systems. To improve edge cloud efficiency with limited communication and computation capacities, we investigate the collaboration between cloud computing and edge computing, where the tasks of mobile devices can be partially processed at the edge node and at the cloud server. First, a joint communication and computation resource allocation problem is formulated to minimize the weighted-sum latency of all mobile devices. Then, the closed-form optimal task splitting strategy is derived as a function of the normalized backhaul communication capacity and the normalized cloud computation capacity. Some interesting and useful insights for the optimal task splitting strategy are also highlighted by analyzing four special scenarios. Based on this, we further transform the original joint communication and computation resource allocation problem into an equivalent convex optimization problem;['10770281', '1703118', '51178155', '1410112765'];['Jinke Ren', 'Guanding Yu', 'Yinghui He', 'Geoffrey Y.

7a2e527b6d51071a54aac7a8bdb56ca735a1f78b;Large-Scale Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation with Superpoint Graphs;We propose a novel deep learning-based framework to tackle the challenge of semantic segmentation of large-scale point clouds of millions of points. We argue that the organization of 3D point clouds can be efficiently captured by a structure called superpoint graph (SPG), derived from a partition of the scanned scene into geometrically homogeneous elements. SPGs offer a compact yet rich representation of contextual relationships between object parts, which is then exploited by a graph convolutional network. Our framework sets a new state of the art for segmenting outdoor LiDAR scans (+11.9 and +8.8 mIoU points for both Semantic3D test sets), as well as indoor scans (+12.4 mIoU points for the S3DIS dataset).;['115987954', '3451689'];['Loic Landrieu', 'M.

a022334521d88eb0181e76f01b53ce42e7dcc302;An Open-Source Benchmark Suite for Microservices and Their Hardware-Software Implications for Cloud & Edge Systems;Cloud services have recently started undergoing a major shift from monolithic applications, to graphs of hundreds or thousands of loosely-coupled microservices. Microservices fundamentally change a lot of assumptions current cloud systems are designed with, and present both opportunities and challenges when optimizing for quality of service (QoS) and cloud utilization. In this paper we explore the implications microservices have across the cloud system stack. We first present DeathStarBench, a novel, open-source benchmark suite built with microservices that is representative of large end-to-end services, modular and extensible. DeathStarBench includes a social network, a media service, an e-commerce site, a banking system, and IoT applications for coordination control of UAV swarms. We then use DeathStarBench to study the architectural characteristics of microservices, their implications in networking and operating systems, their challenges with respect to cluster management, and their trade-offs in terms of application design and programming frameworks.

51871d01c26acb651c81adaf073c32c3d9ec0f0b;Neurosurgeon: Collaborative Intelligence Between the Cloud and Mobile Edge;The computation for today's intelligent personal assistants such as Apple Siri, Google Now, and Microsoft Cortana, is performed in the cloud. This cloud-only approach requires significant amounts of data to be sent to the cloud over the wireless network and puts significant computational pressure on the datacenter. However, as the computational resources in mobile devices become more powerful and energy efficient, questions arise as to whether this cloud-only processing is desirable moving forward, and what are the implications of pushing some or all of this compute to the mobile devices on the edge. In this paper, we examine the status quo approach of cloud-only processing and investigate computation partitioning strategies that effectively leverage both the cycles in the cloud and on the mobile device to achieve low latency, low energy consumption, and high datacenter throughput for this class of intelligent applications.

In this paper, we first study the multi-user computation offloading problem for mobile-edge cloud computing in a multi-channel wireless interference environment. We show that it is NP-hard to compute a centralized optimal solution, and hence adopt a game theoretic approach for achieving efficient computation offloading in a distributed manner. We formulate the distributed computation offloading decision making problem among mobile device users as a multi-user computation offloading game. We analyze the structural property of the game and show that the game admits a Nash equilibrium and possesses the finite improvement property. We then design a distributed computation offloading algorithm that can achieve a Nash equilibrium, derive the upper bound of the convergence time, and quantify its efficiency ratio over the centralized optimal solutions in;['2144230079', '40657800', '1715356', '1799074'];['Xu Chen', 'Lei Jiao', 'Wenzhong Li', 'Xiaoming Fu'];;;;;;;fvurursl;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;2015.0;24;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['cc8d1aa1308d145bdb2652e2c6a6d39418525dbe', '6ac1852ab5fc4c94fe22bcfbbb3fe9bba71dc3d1', '69fc2fa7bffa570b127f7a55ede90f99082e2e84', '21184368e608cccd68e3d602a090aa603c24b8e6', 'c4cf934b5ee4eadbac3a36ed3711475db2670642', '3407e4b1993b44d14c71c1683994b3e58444eb67', '74e2c932d85fe166e158fb8ce3104d559e3af095', '9cfe79734c25c80aa210847320298d3618445e20', '497591fed66f38f1cc00f160858d229d3e810ff2', '9118e5b69edee6acd0c3dc096735df19b9fa6d28', '0f7dd6bcaf4c2a64b3a51b7351929dab23584ea8', '6b42da07552dd40974f793f8da1ca6521f1e49e8']

e50db41ef56a0c33832ac35b269e4b1139903dcb;Cloud RAN for Mobile Networks—A Technology Overview;Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) is a novel mobile network architecture which can address a number of challenges the operators face while trying to support growing end-user's needs. The main idea behind C-RAN is to pool the Baseband Units (BBUs) from multiple base stations into centralized BBU Pool for statistical multiplexing gain, while shifting the burden to the high-speed wireline transmission of In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) data. C-RAN enables energy efficient network operation and possible cost savings on baseband resources.

The buzz around cloud computing has reached a fever pitch. Some believe it is a disruptive trend representing the next stage in the evolution of the internet. Others believe it is hype, as it uses long established computing technologies. One thing is clear: The industry needs an objective, straightforward conversation about how this new computing paradigm will impact organizations, how it can be used with existing technologies, and the potential pitfalls of proprietary technologies that can lead to lock-in and limited choice. This document is intended to initiate a conversation that will bring together the emerging cloud computing community (both cloud users and cloud vendors) around a core set of principles.

The SO-Net models the spatial distribution of point cloud by building a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). Based on the SOM, SO-Net performs hierarchical feature extraction on individual points and SOM nodes, and ultimately represents the input point cloud by a single feature vector. The receptive field of the network can be systematically adjusted by conducting point-to-node k nearest neighbor search. In recognition tasks such as point cloud reconstruction, classification, object part segmentation and shape retrieval, our proposed network demonstrates performance that is similar with or better than state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the training speed is significantly faster than existing point cloud recognition networks because of the parallelizability and simplicity of the proposed architecture.

Developers with innovative ideas for new Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about overprovisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or underprovisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours.

This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation.

Therefore, recovering the complete point clouds from partial ones becomes an indispensable task in many practical applications. In this paper, we present a new method that reformulates point cloud completion as a set-to-set translation problem and design a new model, called PoinTr that adopts a transformer encoder-decoder architecture for point cloud completion. By rep-resenting the point cloud as a set of unordered groups of points with position embeddings, we convert the point cloud to a sequence of point proxies and employ the transformers for point cloud generation. To facilitate transformers to better leverage the inductive bias about 3D geometric structures of point clouds, we further devise a geometry-aware block that models the local geometric relationships explicitly. The migration of transformers enables our model to better learn structural knowledge and preserve detailed;['2116330410', '39358728', '2142663191', '2124814824', '1697700', '2108485135'];['Xumin Yu', 'Yongming Rao', 'Ziyi Wang', 'Zuyan Liu', 'Jiwen Lu', 'Jie Zhou'];7654260e-79f9-45c5-9663-d72027cf88f3;IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision;conference;15;2021.0;Paris;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['dbdcabd0444ad50b68ee09e30f39b66e9068f5d2', 'f0daa4b6f33751ff85fb36cd0583c6769a53e0ec', 'c41a89d744afcdc91cc7b9f05d2abb438ed200c1', '477a1de90ba8f22e4f4068ff8d6233afe74db936', '3849f7c699dce0d70c7002e0e82005a0b712df58', '0b9476177e70d281d4a52aa60809b6a15d2a7523', '3c8a456509e6c0805354bd40a35e3f2dbf8069b1', 'f0ff1e0739494fcbaeefc3e30038457ed606b1c4', '24472a31618bbc260e2bf45bd72427097875142b', 'fdde9a63877db44c1b6a7f5cff5d47f01465e793', 'b6cf10713451191de8f0d30211f85a1080249a74', 'd8ba2965be9cc93439c5bb52961b504c39f16e80', 'a58715797b61588cbd020b9a98292a98f8483420', '41edd975efbbc5af28971bc2669d9a1ae6ee8ace', '1335190de78e0b58fbf7a7c7c52fa1a15f14858a', '9ebdd272db2596f4f4bee741d6399363b2b6559f', '840e804bb5ed1944e494959c2980a90bea0675c4', 'e1799aaf23c12af6932dc0ef3dfb1638f01413d1', '80f5ee8578ee76e2c17824f211762ffec7e029d4', 'b3159fd22e19e24d7cde9d37b3e482b832d4fa58', '204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776', '8674494bd7a076286b905912d26d47f7501c4046', '42b1cb0030e174ba4395d987df77cfa6d112d221', '41d08fb733f3e50ac183490f84d6377dffccf350', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba']
0d46406058396f66fca4a248b897956159dfabcb;PointFlow: 3D Point Cloud Generation With Continuous Normalizing Flows;As 3D point clouds become the representation of choice for multiple vision and graphics applications, the ability to synthesize or reconstruct high-resolution, high-fidelity point clouds becomes crucial. Despite the recent success of deep learning models in discriminative tasks of point clouds, generating point clouds remains challenging. This paper proposes a principled probabilistic framework to generate 3D point clouds by modeling them as a distribution of distributions. Specifically, we learn a two-level hierarchy of distributions where the first level is the distribution of shapes and the second level is the distribution of points given a shape. This formulation allows us to both sample shapes and sample an arbitrary number of points from a shape. Our generative model, named PointFlow, learns each level of the distribution with a continuous normalizing flow. The invertibility of normalizing flows enables the computation of the likelihood during training and allows us to train our model in;['29983981', '144247007', '19235216', '39793900', '50172592', '1790580'];['Guandao Yang', 'Xun Huang', 'Zekun Hao', 'Ming-Yu Liu', 'Serge J.

4f940cfbfa70c67ecb026478a8607fa7ec376220;Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation For Cloud Assisted Mobile Edge Computing in Vehicular Networks;Computation offloading services provide required computing resources for vehicles with computation-intensive tasks. Past computation offloading research mainly focused on mobile edge computing (MEC) or cloud computing, separately. This paper presents a collaborative approach based on MEC and cloud computing that offloads services to automobiles in vehicular networks. A cloud-MEC collaborative computation offloading problem is formulated through jointly optimizing computation offloading decision and computation resource allocation. Since the problem is non-convex and NP-hard, we propose a collaborative computation offloading and resource allocation optimization (CCORAO) scheme, and design a distributed computation offloading and resource allocation algorithm for CCORAO scheme that achieves the optimal solution. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the system utility and computation time, especially for the scenario where the MEC servers fail to meet demands due to insufficient computation resources.;['2685496', '2108273385', '143929757', '49481130'];['Junhui Zhao', 'Qiuping Li', 'Yi Gong', 'Ke Zhang'];;;;;;;x0gaxmer;IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology;2019.0;68;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['bc11a01d61b5c217b90a2d575f8d07a42984c099', '13513bb13ff668f7d7cf341d2a8712dea6455674', '7ce15c684af9e8df03244ae95e4d6ac77e292c3d', '96cf663aaf3d3da7d1485be4fcfa89e42a7cf85e', '359ae7f918e7ab865cc10847dcbfa9ce8bf95365', '51c25e737058f6e6d603cad16c378971f50fac58', '49f6bcda210e7a60a0f4584dcf6cbcc8a041d0e8', 'a2f808a24d996f9e9d0bfc054128c69b73d96767', '50711657ca793dc473e81f97958e2242c95741e2', 'c6c779ee3b702a22d8704fad98f748c34b1cdcb1', '0d88252e3a8777618d680fbb7fe64f8c1bdd1483']
80f5ee8578ee76e2c17824f211762ffec7e029d4;VoxelNet: End-to-End Learning for Point Cloud Based 3D Object Detection;Accurate detection of objects in 3D point clouds is a central problem in many applications, such as autonomous navigation, housekeeping robots, and augmented/virtual reality. To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN), most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically, VoxelNet divides a point cloud into equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a descriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to generate detections.;['2118860832', '2577513'];['Yin Zhou', 'Oncel Tuzel'];;;;;;;771gidaj;2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition;2017.0;59;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['04ee2f5afb0883803f31397aa32ec62a5691d94c', '79cfb51a51fc093f66aac8e858afe2e14d4a1f20', '8674494bd7a076286b905912d26d47f7501c4046', '7d39d69b23424446f0400ef603b2e3e22d0309d6', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba', '6d7d48fdde91604d8047e8574b11d05465d9e0be', 'dc200ab22bf63e10e8b2af328a9e072d82cf75b7', 'a0d4b0fd59c2bfba02b79309d9c62ca64ee6d457', 'da09eaa1412aaf0a62622f01f50e2e801a3b4c52', 'd821767b7c7315c69daa39fbb0f4a44426bfaf41', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d', '940dd2fa074ad97d5e8efa7e867b1f4460cfb8d5']

The whole framework is composed of two stages: stage-1 for the bottom-up 3D proposal generation and stage-2 for refining proposals in the canonical coordinates to obtain the final detection results. Instead of generating proposals from RGB image or projecting point cloud to bird's view or voxels as previous methods do, our stage-1 sub-network directly generates a small number of high-quality 3D proposals from point cloud in a bottom-up manner via segmenting the point cloud of the whole scene into foreground points and background. The stage-2 sub-network transforms the pooled points of each proposal to canonical coordinates to learn better local spatial features, which is combined with global semantic features of each point learned in stage-1 for accurate box refinement and confidence prediction.

Unlike previous work, we densely connect each point with every other in a local neighborhood, aiming to specify feature of each point based on the local region characteristics for better representing the region. A novel module, namely Adaptive Feature Adjustment (AFA) module, is presented to find the interaction between points. For each local region, an impact map carrying element-wise impact between point pairs is applied to the feature difference map. Each feature is then pulled or pushed by other features in the same region according to the adaptively learned impact indicators. The adjusted features are well encoded with region information, and thus benefit the point cloud recognition tasks, such as point cloud segmentation and classification. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-arts on both semantic segmentation and shape classification datasets.;['3459894', '2108810714', '144856288', '1729056'];['Hengshuang Zhao', 'Li Jiang', 'Chi-Wing Fu', 'Jiaya Jia'];768b87bb-8a18-4d9c-a161-4d483c776bcf;Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition;conference;10;2019.0;London;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['63b059cdad77906ff381515b3cfac21757e5e64c', 'b256e7155dd1a27ed9233aa4b47fd6334f5f243b', '7bbcd665f4847652e307ca717b209de92cd95dd2', '3a2823f29bb664ebcd8d440fc5b0952399c3aa10', '2a33d0939cb4f9200d401a453146bb120ee3b403', 'e1799aaf23c12af6932dc0ef3dfb1638f01413d1', '6400c36efdb8a66b401b6aef26c057227266fddd', '7a2e527b6d51071a54aac7a8bdb56ca735a1f78b', '80f5ee8578ee76e2c17824f211762ffec7e029d4', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '131660f9f10a831968f2fafa0985f1b5eeb0b337', '8674494bd7a076286b905912d26d47f7501c4046', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba', '511ff60d4aa5ab2660552f02ee85692425912b46', '4cdcf2ae5e1fafebd9b3613247a7b1962584da34', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d']

Six forms of water substance (water vapor, cloud water, cloud ice, rain, snow and hail, i.e., graupel) are simulated. The model utilizes the “bulk water” microphysical parameterization technique to represent the precipitation fields which are all assumed to follow exponential size distribution functions. Autoconversion concepts are used to parameterize the collision-coalescence and collision-aggregation processes. Accretion processes involving the various forms of liquid and solid hydrometeors are simulated in this model. The transformation of cloud ice to snow through autoconversion (aggregation) and Bergeron process and subsequent accretional growth or aggregation to form hail are simulated.

An organization has to create data centres to store, manage, and process the information to achieve benefits from data and make decisions. Cloud gives organizations a successful approach that leads to profit without maintaining the cost of data centres and technical staff to manage the services. Cloud has different types of architectures, types of clouds, and cost packages for using the cloud. These services can be scaled up or down when required by an organization. Cloud has unbeatable future because IT world is acquiring it and giving a boost to their businesses. Many cloud providers are using it and the remaining are moving to cloud. Cloud computing also gives birth to edge computing, fog computing, and many more zero downtime solutions.;['19182651'];['Ekaba Bisong'];;;;;;;p4eyyqcx;Cloud Technologies;2019.0;20;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['9f3ebaf46bda931ba596c0959f0321ddfe34e922', '6f017b648677725a49780ebbdf35198487351382', '45e65b8edff09d97c2a329699105eed8db430f3a', '1923472cacb63e80cec937fd2c8e8d9631266a6a', '147ab7ec4c77bd9941dd6b4bbf3a039a6676cc10', '36d28725fa8a876e2657988790489c95d7de0a2e', '05a2f1fe94ac485d9adf9a5bce131b66c56b47c4', 'f6871be408813171daa2521061658aeaa4708bba', 'e71aca83459cd6f3000f098b6ea152d19fdd8ca8', 'dac1b1f5a3a3734cc00995841dfe2185a06ba4a7', 'b2fdee22aa02477292b858fbafcb418932732bce']
b2b0c31d036941cb557be4afb7101dc1b72f17cb;Revisiting Point Cloud Classification: A New Benchmark Dataset and Classification Model on Real-World Data;Deep learning techniques for point cloud data have demonstrated great potentials in solving classical problems in 3D computer vision such as 3D object classification and segmentation. Several recent 3D object classification methods have reported state-of-the-art performance on CAD model datasets such as ModelNet40 with high accuracy (~92\%). Despite such impressive results, in this paper, we argue that object classification is still a challenging task when objects are framed with real-world settings. To prove this, we introduce ScanObjectNN, a new real-world point cloud object dataset based on scanned indoor scene data. From our comprehensive benchmark, we show that our dataset poses great challenges to existing point cloud classification techniques as objects from real-world scans are often cluttered with background and/or are partial due to occlusions. We identify three key open problems for point cloud object classification, and propose new point cloud classification neural networks that achieve state-of-the-art performance on classifying objects;['41022658', '39701719', '143807806', '1779016', '123914790'];['M.

572a5aa00f0569887469ffb7554699c21156ba0b;FoldingNet: Point Cloud Auto-Encoder via Deep Grid Deformation;Recent deep networks that directly handle points in a point set, e.g., PointNet, have been state-of-the-art for supervised learning tasks on point clouds such as classification and segmentation. In this work, a novel end-to-end deep auto-encoder is proposed to address unsupervised learning challenges on point clouds. On the encoder side, a graph-based enhancement is enforced to promote local structures on top of PointNet. Then, a novel folding-based decoder deforms a canonical 2D grid onto the underlying 3D object surface of a point cloud, achieving low reconstruction errors even for objects with delicate structures. The proposed decoder only uses about 7% parameters of a decoder with fully-connected neural networks, yet leads to a more discriminative representation that achieves higher linear SVM classification accuracy than the benchmark. In addition, the proposed decoder structure is shown, in theory, to be a generic architecture that is able to reconstruct an arbitrary point cloud from;['49576470', '144066717', '2577784', '144309297'];['Yaoqing Yang', 'Chen Feng', 'Yiru Shen', 'Dong Tian'];;;;;;;3u41adri;2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition;2017.0;90;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['5eb4a5ac7faa2fc75e1739b45c511ba3fab5bb56', 'd22a270ec055216580164b4f297089845065ff23', 'b3159fd22e19e24d7cde9d37b3e482b832d4fa58', '30d148d21c20c1682bfbea5ffa41d83c8abdc64c', '8674494bd7a076286b905912d26d47f7501c4046', 'b5007972c6f5a2294f83357c73e12664dd7c85b3', '7040c149b797506426177d23d5ab52d402fa0fd7', '1a39bb2caa151d15efd6718f3a80d9f4bff95af2', 'f48d322244c906b45792b28206df7cfb23495004', 'a456265138c088a894301c0433dae938705a9bec', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba', '41d08fb733f3e50ac183490f84d6377dffccf350', 'f09f7888aa5aeaf88a2a44aea768d9a8747e97d2', '0e779fd59353a7f1f5b559b9d65fa4bfe367890c', '511ff60d4aa5ab2660552f02ee85692425912b46', '729d5c7dc6bfb32e47b5bd24cdb01ccaaf62bba5', '76cee11c6a9f1424f03571378a966c1417ff2935', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '87c757138d273ccd38216ca5266406a503507077', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '15ca7adccf5cd4dc309cdcaa6328f4c429ead337', '7c6de5a9e02a779e24504619050c6118f4eac181', '18b47b83a373f33d6b902a3615f42c10f7600d72', '5d1bfeed240709725c78bc72ea40e55410b373dc']
22cc76c6d9b25facb2874bbcbbbfe781a4d85bcd;Point-GNN: Graph Neural Network for 3D Object Detection in a Point Cloud;In this paper, we propose a graph neural network to detect objects from a LiDAR point cloud. Towards this end, we encode the point cloud efficiently in a fixed radius near-neighbors graph. We design a graph neural network, named Point-GNN, to predict the category and shape of the object that each vertex in the graph belongs to. In Point-GNN, we propose an auto-registration mechanism to reduce translation variance, and also design a box merging and scoring operation to combine detections from multiple vertices accurately. Our experiments on the KITTI benchmark show the proposed approach achieves leading accuracy using the point cloud alone and can even surpass fusion-based algorithms. Our results demonstrate the potential of using the graph neural network as a new approach for 3D object detection.

However, resource constrained devices cannot fulfill the resource-requirements of these applications. This paper investigates the computation offloading problem of the coexistence and synergy between fog computing and cloud computing in IoE by jointly optimizing the offloading decisions, the allocation of computation resource and transmit power. Specifically, we propose an energy-efficient computation offloading and resource allocation (ECORA) scheme to minimize the system cost. The simulation results verify the proposed scheme can effectively decrease the system cost by up to 50% compared with the existing schemes, especially for the scenario that the computation resource of fog computing is relatively small or the number of devices increases.;['2108273385', '2685496', '143929757', '153441769'];['Qiuping Li', 'Junhui Zhao', 'Yi Gong', 'Qingmiao Zhang'];;;;;;;8g02kf5k;China Communications;2019.0;16;['Computer Science'];['359ae7f918e7ab865cc10847dcbfa9ce8bf95365', '51c25e737058f6e6d603cad16c378971f50fac58', 'c6c779ee3b702a22d8704fad98f748c34b1cdcb1', '0d88252e3a8777618d680fbb7fe64f8c1bdd1483']

Highest concentrations occurred during, but were not limited to, periods of sustained high winds and overcast skies, presumably owing to faster exchange from surface seawater and less photochemical activity in the atmosphere. Lowest values occurred during airflow from continental regions, which provides higher levels of oxidants and free radicals to react with DMS. Averaged over time, the concentrations in clean marine air reached a maximum at night and a minimum in the afternoon, when concentrations were about one third lower than during the nighttime maximum.

Location recognition is often cast as an image retrieval problem and recent research has almost exclusively focused on improving the chance that a relevant database image is ranked high enough after retrieval. The implicit assumption is that the number of inliers found by spatial verification can be used to distinguish between a related and an unrelated database photo with high precision. In this paper, we show that this assumption does not hold for large datasets due to the appearance of geometric bursts, i.e., sets of visual elements appearing in similar geometric configurations in unrelated database photos. We propose algorithms for detecting and handling geometric bursts. Although conceptually simple, using the proposed weighting schemes dramatically improves the recall that can be achieved when high precision is required compared to;['1959475', '3276694', '144810819', '1742208'];['Torsten Sattler', 'M.

d19356ce442d9c04625b3a253f370feaf00ea6a0;GS3D: An Efficient 3D Object Detection Framework for Autonomous Driving;We present an efficient 3D object detection framework based on a single RGB image in the scenario of autonomous driving. Our efforts are put on extracting the underlying 3D information in a 2D image and determining the accurate 3D bounding box of object without point cloud or stereo data. Leveraging the off-the-shelf 2D object detector, we propose an artful approach to efficiently obtain a coarse cuboid for each predicted 2D box. The coarse cuboid has enough accuracy to guide us to determine the 3D box of the object by refinement. In contrast to previous state-of-the-art methods that only use the features extracted from the 2D bounding box for box refinement, we explore the 3D structure information of the object by employing the visual features of visible surfaces. The new features from surfaces are utilized to eliminate the problem of representation ambiguity brought by only using 2D bounding box. Moreover, we;['40940627', '3001348', '2053947248', '2550719', '93768810'];['Buyu Li', 'Wanli Ouyang', 'Lu Sheng', 'Xingyu Zeng', 'Xiaogang Wang'];768b87bb-8a18-4d9c-a161-4d483c776bcf;Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition;conference;1;2019.0;New York;;;;;['Computer Science'];['d2420d9ce64d101b28641660b4641c415fc7a6c9', '7ce6eca495909de2ffa0b6d9c16993757208764e', 'bf2793fc09176f8bf23b3a2b3c6b32185e8a8329', '80f5ee8578ee76e2c17824f211762ffec7e029d4', 'dc200ab22bf63e10e8b2af328a9e072d82cf75b7', 'd821767b7c7315c69daa39fbb0f4a44426bfaf41']
8352e3ba20cb0fd48e2514bc1948e68108943e39;SOCK: Rapid Task Provisioning with Serverless-Optimized Containers;Serverless computing promises to provide applications with cost savings and extreme elasticity. Unfortunately, slow application and container initialization can hurt common-case latency on serverless platforms. In this work, we analyze Linux container primitives, identifying scalability bottlenecks related to storage and network isolation. We also analyze Python applications from GitHub and show that importing many popular libraries adds about 100 ms to startup. Based on these findings, we implement SOCK, a container system optimized for serverless workloads. Careful avoidance of kernel scalability bottlenecks gives SOCK an 18× speedup over Docker. A generalized-Zygote provisioning strategy yields an additional 3× speedup. A more sophisticated three-tier caching strategy based on Zygotes provides a 45× speedup over SOCK without Zygotes. Relative to AWS Lambda and OpenWhisk, OpenLambda with SOCK reduces platform overheads by 2.8× and 5.3× respectively in an image processing case study.;['40448383', '71508283', '2112224469', '39408795', '3561274', '1398193802', '1398193806'];['Edward Oakes', 'Leon Yang', 'Dennis Zhou', 'Kevin Houck', 'T.

63b059cdad77906ff381515b3cfac21757e5e64c;Deep Ordinal Regression Network for Monocular Depth Estimation;Monocular depth estimation, which plays a crucial role in understanding 3D scene geometry, is an ill-posed problem. Recent methods have gained significant improvement by exploring image-level information and hierarchical features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). These methods model depth estimation as a regression problem and train the regression networks by minimizing mean squared error, which suffers from slow convergence and unsatisfactory local solutions. Besides, existing depth estimation networks employ repeated spatial pooling operations, resulting in undesirable low-resolution feature maps. To obtain high-resolution depth maps, skip-connections or multilayer deconvolution networks are required, which complicates network training and consumes much more computations. To eliminate or at least largely reduce these problems, we introduce a spacing-increasing discretization (SID) strategy to discretize depth and recast depth network learning as an ordinal regression problem. By training the network using an ordinary regression loss, our method achieves much higher accuracy and faster convergence in synch.;['145150876', '29393235', '2135743236', '3443176', '143719920'];['Huan Fu', 'Mingming Gong', 'Chaohui Wang', 'K.

66c268d2a74f863586788cc154ad2ec06aa075e7;Graph-Based Object Classification for Neuromorphic Vision Sensing;"Neuromorphic vision sensing (NVS) devices represent visual information as sequences of asynchronous discrete events (a.k.a., ""spikes'"") in response to changes in scene reflectance. Unlike conventional active pixel sensing (APS), NVS allows for significantly higher event sampling rates at substantially increased energy efficiency and robustness to illumination changes. However, object classification with NVS streams cannot leverage on state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), since NVS does not produce frame representations. To circumvent this mismatch between sensing and processing with CNNs, we propose a compact graph representation for NVS. We couple this with novel residual graph CNN architectures and show that, when trained on spatio-temporal NVS data for object classification, such residual graph CNNs preserve the spatial and temporal coherence of spike events, while requiring less computation and memory. Finally, to address the absence of large real-world NVS datasets for complex recognition tasks, we present and make available a 100k dataset of NVS";['2057245555', '33998511', '2822935', '2820254', '2747620'];['Yin Bi', 'Aaron Chadha', 'Alhabib Abbas', 'Eirina Bourtsoulatze', 'Y.

Our method first aims to generate a set of candidate class-specific object proposals, which are then run through a standard CNN pipeline to obtain high-quality object detections. The focus of this paper is on proposal generation. In particular, we propose an energy minimization approach that places object candidates in 3D using the fact that objects should be on the ground-plane. We then score each candidate box projected to the image plane via several intuitive potentials encoding semantic segmentation, contextual information, size and location priors and typical object shape.

Previous approaches to these problems either relied heavily on programmer support to partition an application, or they were coarse-grained requiring full process (or full VM) migration. MAUI uses the benefits of a managed code environment to offer the best of both worlds: it supports fine-grained code offload to maximize energy savings with minimal burden on the programmer. MAUI decides at run-time which methods should be remotely executed, driven by an optimization engine that achieves the best energy savings possible under the mobile device's current connectivity constrains. In our evaluation, we show that MAUI enables: 1) a resource-intensive face recognition application that consumes an order of magnitude less energy, 2) a latency-sensitive arcade game application that doubles its refresh rate, and 3) a voice-based language translation application that bypasses the limitations of the smartphone;['2055924', '143859272', '31687893', '1793636', '2817840', '39403445', '2292948'];['Eduardo Cuervo', 'A.

Our method trains an RNNbased neural network architecture to solve multiple view inter-prediction tasks for each shape. Given several nearby views of a shape, we define view inter-prediction as the task of predicting the center view between the input views, and reconstructing the input views in a low-level feature space. The key idea of our approach is to implement the shape representation as a shape-specific global memory that is shared between all local view inter-predictions for each shape. Intuitively, this memory enables the system to aggregate information that is useful to better solve the view inter-prediction tasks for each shape, and to leverage the memory as a viewindependent shape representation.

There is no way to speed up the inference process by classical lookup tables due to the high-dimensional input and limited memory size. Recently, a novel architecture (PointNet) for point clouds has demonstrated that it is possible to obtain a complicated deep function from a set of 3-variable functions. In this paper, we exploit this property and apply a lookup table to encode these 3-variable functions. This method ensures that the inference time is only determined by the memory access no matter how complicated the deep function is. We conduct extensive experiments on ModelNet and ShapeNet datasets and demonstrate that we can complete the inference process in 1.5 ms on an Intel i7-8700 CPU (single core mode), 32× speedup over the PointNet architecture without any performance degradation.;['151503658', '151483090', '2110584055', '47636228', '2442939'];['Hongxin Lin', 'Zelin Xiao', 'Yang Tan', 'Hongyang Chao', 'Shengyong Ding'];975e1529-a14b-436f-ad7e-a09d8eabc50d;IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo;conference;17;2019.0;Beijing;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['1c838ffc6c4b63a577c9cb3d8d86c8ba14915640', '49b0b43e57dc8efe3a92f06ddcb5a7f39da4790d', 'e1799aaf23c12af6932dc0ef3dfb1638f01413d1', '8674494bd7a076286b905912d26d47f7501c4046', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba']
131660f9f10a831968f2fafa0985f1b5eeb0b337;SEGCloud: Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds;3D semantic scene labeling is fundamental to agents operating in the real world. In particular, labeling raw 3D point sets from sensors provides fine-grained semantics. Recent works leverage the capabilities of Neural Networks (NNs), but are limited to coarse voxel predictions and do not explicitly enforce global consistency. We present SEGCloud, an end-to-end framework to obtain 3D point-level segmentation that combines the advantages of NNs, trilinear interpolation(TI) and fully connected Conditional Random Fields (FC-CRF). Coarse voxel predictions from a 3D Fully Convolutional NN are transferred back to the raw 3D points via trilinear interpolation. Then the FC-CRF enforces global consistency and provides fine-grained semantics on the points. We implement the latter as a differentiable Recurrent NN to allow joint optimization. We evaluate the framework on two indoor and two outdoor 3D datasets (NYU V2, S3DIS, KITTI, this http URL), and show performance comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art on all;['26917145', '2144103', '1798372', '39813007', '1702137'];['Lyne P.

6351ebb4a3287f5f3e1273464b3b91e5df5a16d7;Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners;This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3× or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data.;['2058350112', '39717886', '1817030', '3128506', '2065731243', '2983898'];"['Kaiming He', 'Xinlei Chen', 'Saining Xie', 'Yanghao Li', ""Piotr Doll'ar"", 'Ross B.

We consider the problem of the semantic classification of 3D LiDAR point clouds obtained from urban scenes when the training set is limited. We propose a non-parametric segmentation model for urban scenes composed of anthropic objects of simple shapes, partionning the scene into geometrically-homogeneous segments which size is determined by the local complexity. This segmentation can be integrated into a conditional random field classifier (CRF) in order to capture the high-level structure of the scene. For each cluster, this allows us to aggregate the noisy predictions of a weakly-supervised classifier to produce a higher confidence data term. We demonstrate the improvement provided by our method over two publicly-available large-scale data sets.;['35957225', '115987954'];['S.

The evolution of cloud computing is one of the major advances in the computing area as well as in economics of using computing. There are three major technologies which represent cloud computing: Software-asa-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (Iaas). In our example we discuss pros and cons of implementing PaaS or SaaS. While there are quite a few papers covering technical aspects of cloud computing technologies, this paper will have focus on economics of the cloud. In this paper we will try to explain which criteria should be considered when deciding to move or not to move to cloud.

We found that load balancing mechanisms (and some policies) in servers used in typical n-tier systems (e.g., Apache and Tomcat) have issues of instability when very long response time (VLRT) requests appear due to millibottlenecks, very short bottlenecks that last only tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Experiments with standard n-tier benchmarks show that during millibottlenecks, some load balancing policy/mechanism combinations make the mistake of sending new requests to the node(s) suffering from millibottlenecks, instead of the idle nodes as load balancers are supposed to do. Several of these mistakes are due to the implicit assumptions made by load balancing policies and mechanisms on the stability of system state. Our study shows that appropriate remedies at policy and mechanism levels can avoid these mistakes during millibottlenecks and remove the VLRT requests,;['2072832806', '32657617', '145801568', '6014550', '2186906', '145932397', '2115979102'];['T.

d8ba2965be9cc93439c5bb52961b504c39f16e80;RL-GAN-Net: A Reinforcement Learning Agent Controlled GAN Network for Real-Time Point Cloud Shape Completion;We present RL-GAN-Net, where a reinforcement learning (RL) agent provides fast and robust control of a generative adversarial network (GAN). Our framework is applied to point cloud shape completion that converts noisy, partial point cloud data into a high-fidelity completed shape by controlling the GAN. While a GAN is unstable and hard to train, we circumvent the problem by (1) training the GAN on the latent space representation whose dimension is reduced compared to the raw point cloud input and (2) using an RL agent to find the correct input to the GAN to generate the latent space representation of the shape that best fits the current input of incomplete point cloud. The suggested pipeline robustly completes point cloud with large missing regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to train an RL agent to control the GAN, which effectively learns the highly nonlinear mapping;['31155025', '2109348150', '47659765'];['M.

In this paper, we proposed a novel approach named EnaCloud, which enables application live placement dynamically with consideration of energy efficiency in a cloud platform. In EnaCloud, we use a Virtual Machine to encapsulate the application, which supports applications scheduling and live migration to minimize the number of running machines, so as to save energy. Specially, the application placement is abstracted as a bin packing problem, and an energy-aware heuristic algorithm is proposed to get an appropriate solution. In addition, an over-provision approach is presented to deal with the varying resource demands of applications.

21248bcc81539e7cd1ef83b3b184768603f6f247;Hybrid Task Cascade for Instance Segmentation;"Cascade is a classic yet powerful architecture that has boosted performance on various tasks. However, how to introduce cascade to instance segmentation remains an open question. A simple combination of Cascade R-CNN and Mask R-CNN only brings limited gain. In exploring a more effective approach, we find that the key to a successful instance segmentation cascade is to fully leverage the reciprocal relationship between detection and segmentation. In this work, we propose a new framework, Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC), which differs in two important aspects: (1) instead of performing cascaded refinement on these two tasks separately, it interweaves them for a joint multi-stage processing; (2) it adopts a fully convolutional branch to provide spatial context, which can help distinguishing hard foreground from cluttered background. Overall, this framework can learn more discriminative features progressively while integrating complementary features together in each stage.

fe6901f657ea8457cf30a5360916f2f14de58870;vManage: loosely coupled platform and virtualization management in data centers;Management is an important challenge for future enterprises. Previous work has addressed platform management (e.g., power and thermal management) separately from virtualization management (e.g., virtual machine (VM) provisioning, application performance). Coordinating the actions taken by these different management layers is important and beneficial, for reasons of performance, stability, and efficiency. Such coordination, in addition to working well with existing multi-vendor solutions, also needs to be extensible to support future new management solutions potentially operating on different sensors and actuators. In response to these requirements, this paper proposes vManage, a solution to loosely couple platform and virtualization management and facilitate coordination between them in data centers. Our solution is comprised of registry and proxy mechanisms that provide unified monitoring and actuation across platform and virtualization domains, and coordinators that provide policy execution for better VM placement and runtime management, including a formal approach to ensure system stability from inefficient management actions.;['2145349495', '2644598', '2107884841', '1770926', '1718471'];['Sanjay Kumar', 'V.

Indeed, 5G will need to be a paradigm shift that includes very high carrier frequencies with massive bandwidths, extreme base station and device densities, and unprecedented numbers of antennas. However, unlike the previous four generations, it will also be highly integrative: tying any new 5G air interface and spectrum together with LTE and WiFi to provide universal high-rate coverage and a seamless user experience. To support this, the core network will also have to reach unprecedented levels of flexibility and intelligence, spectrum regulation will need to be rethought and improved, and energy and cost efficiencies will become even more critical considerations.

b42b1ba256783184f714cc27ececbfb52e247f34;DensePoint: Learning Densely Contextual Representation for Efficient Point Cloud Processing;Point cloud processing is very challenging, as the diverse shapes formed by irregular points are often indistinguishable. A thorough grasp of the elusive shape requires sufficiently contextual semantic information, yet few works devote to this. Here we propose DensePoint, a general architecture to learn densely contextual representation for point cloud processing. Technically, it extends regular grid CNN to irregular point configuration by generalizing a convolution operator, which holds the permutation invariance of points, and achieves efficient inductive learning of local patterns. Architecturally, it finds inspiration from dense connection mode, to repeatedly aggregate multi-level and multi-scale semantics in a deep hierarchy. As a result, densely contextual information along with rich semantics, can be acquired by DensePoint in an organic manner, making it highly effective. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across four tasks, as well as thorough model analysis, verify DensePoint achieves the state of the arts.;['1865017658', '145211780', '3182192', '1697700', '1683738', '144809241'];['Yongcheng Liu', 'Bin Fan', 'Gaofeng Meng', 'Jiwen Lu', 'Shiming Xiang', 'Chunhong Pan'];7654260e-79f9-45c5-9663-d72027cf88f3;IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision;conference;17;2019.0;Berlin;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['a58715797b61588cbd020b9a98292a98f8483420', '52afbe99de04878a5ac73a4adad4b1cedae8a6ce', 'ac7072f8446cafabfade74e274ca4b2a90587e61', '2c2d7daabd764f981950b71230e3ac96a0d21984', '04b54d8c4a327f143c3d00fc432740e1183f2337', '3a2823f29bb664ebcd8d440fc5b0952399c3aa10', '49b0b43e57dc8efe3a92f06ddcb5a7f39da4790d', '9ebdd272db2596f4f4bee741d6399363b2b6559f', '2a33d0939cb4f9200d401a453146bb120ee3b403', 'e1799aaf23c12af6932dc0ef3dfb1638f01413d1', '6400c36efdb8a66b401b6aef26c057227266fddd', '51a2bc2e8fb8ed47a085df33dd965e57335080a0', '5eb4a5ac7faa2fc75e1739b45c511ba3fab5bb56', '7a2e527b6d51071a54aac7a8bdb56ca735a1f78b', '204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776', '8674494bd7a076286b905912d26d47f7501c4046', '1a39bb2caa151d15efd6718f3a80d9f4bff95af2', 'f48d322244c906b45792b28206df7cfb23495004', 'a456265138c088a894301c0433dae938705a9bec', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba', '511ff60d4aa5ab2660552f02ee85692425912b46', '729d5c7dc6bfb32e47b5bd24cdb01ccaaf62bba5', '4cdcf2ae5e1fafebd9b3613247a7b1962584da34', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d']
b8b11e8152fa900ab34aabb30f9542ffe7d4c453;Joint Computation Partitioning and Resource Allocation for Latency Sensitive Applications in Mobile Edge Clouds;The proliferation of mobile devices and ubiquitous access of the wireless network enables many new mobile applications such as augmented reality, mobile gaming and so on. As the applications are latency sensitive, researchers propose to offload the complex computations of these applications to the nearby mobile edge cloud, in order to reduce the latency. Existing works mostly consider the problem of partitioning the computations between the mobile device and the traditional cloud that has abundant resources. The proposed approaches can not be applied in the context of mobile edge cloud, because both the resources in the mobile edge cloud and the wireless access bandwidth to the edge cloud are constrained. In this paper, we study joint computation partitioning and resource allocation problem for latency sensitive applications in mobile edge clouds. The problem is novel in that we combine the computation partitioning and the two-dimensional resource allocations in both the computation;['2108712780', '2156639656', '144115026', '49780283', '2116528180'];['Lei Yang', 'Bojin Liu', 'Jiannong Cao', 'Yuvraj Sahni', 'Zhenyu Wang'];406d9f60-417a-4dc5-a6b7-1fe4689a4ff7;IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing;conference;7;2017.0;Paris;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['0d88252e3a8777618d680fbb7fe64f8c1bdd1483', '731304583d2e40bf6ee030e3cd81f767713f999a', '0f7dd6bcaf4c2a64b3a51b7351929dab23584ea8', 'a4d0d6b6fce22162518f8b6a569c2c61e8d03da1']

In this paper, we propose RS-CNN, namely, Relation-Shape Convolutional Neural Network, which extends regular grid CNN to irregular configuration for point cloud analysis. The key to RS-CNN is learning from relation, i.e., the geometric topology constraint among points. Specifically, the convolutional weight for local point set is forced to learn a high-level relation expression from predefined geometric priors, between a sampled point from this point set and the others. In this way, an inductive local representation with explicit reasoning about the spatial layout of points can be obtained, which leads to much shape awareness and robustness. With this convolution as a basic operator, RS-CNN, a hierarchical architecture can be developed to achieve contextual shape-aware learning for point cloud analysis.

ab33e9ced1913a2dd687e5e8f7af9efc9a8673d9;Hermes: Latency Optimal Task Assignment for Resource-constrained Mobile Computing;With mobile devices increasingly able to connect to cloud servers from anywhere, resource-constrained devices can potentially perform offloading of computational tasks to either save local resource usage or improve performance. It is of interest to find optimal assignments of tasks to local and remote devices that can take into account the application-specific profile, availability of computational resources, and link connectivity, and find a balance between energy consumption costs of mobile devices and latency for delay-sensitive applications. We formulate an NP-hard problem to minimize the application latency while meeting prescribed resource utilization constraints. Different from most of existing works that either rely on the integer programming solver, or on heuristics that offer no theoretical performance guarantees, we propose Hermes, a novel fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS).

However, directly applying convolutions on point clouds is challenging due to the sparse, irregular and unordered data structure. In this paper, we propose a novel Interpolated Convolution operation, InterpConv, to tackle the point cloud feature learning and understanding problem. The key idea is to utilize a set of discrete kernel weights and interpolate point features to neighboring kernel-weight coordinates by an interpolation function for convolution. A normalization term is introduced to handle neighborhoods of different sparsity levels. Our InterpConv is shown to be permutation and sparsity invariant, and can directly handle irregular inputs. We further design Interpolated Convolutional Neural Networks (InterpCNNs) based on InterpConv layers to handle point cloud recognition tasks including shape classification, object part segmentation and indoor scene semantic parsing.

ba8d37f2e98d70f917d0d3a49c387cef6867e65e;Learning shape correspondence with anisotropic convolutional neural networks;Establishing correspondence between shapes is a fundamental problem in geometry processing, arising in a wide variety of applications. The problem is especially difficult in the setting of non-isometric deformations, as well as in the presence of topological noise and missing parts, mainly due to the limited capability to model such deformations axiomatically. Several recent works showed that invariance to complex shape transformations can be learned from examples. In this paper, we introduce an intrinsic convolutional neural network architecture based on anisotropic diffusion kernels, which we term Anisotropic Convolutional Neural Network (ACNN). In our construction, we generalize convolutions to non-Euclidean domains by constructing a set of oriented anisotropic diffusion kernels, creating in this way a local intrinsic polar representation of the data (`patch'), which is then correlated with a filter.

This paper extends a popular semi-direct approach to monocular visual odometry known as SVO [1] to work with line segments, hence obtaining a more robust system capable of dealing with both textured and structured environments. The proposed odometry system allows for the fast tracking of line segments since it eliminates the necessity of continuously extracting and matching features between subsequent frames. The method, of course, has a higher computational burden than the original SVO, but it still runs with frequencies of 60Hz on a personal computer while performing robustly in a wider variety of scenarios.;['1403239539', '2446207', '2281407946'];['Ruben Gomez-Ojeda', 'Jesus Briales', 'Javier González Jiménez'];37275deb-3fcf-4d16-ae77-95db9899b1f3;IEEE/RJS International Conference on Intelligent RObots and Systems;conference;3;2016.0;Berlin;;;;;['Computer Science'];[]
d916830788be8306ee896cb246615c5b217439a4;Meltdown: Reading Kernel Memory from User Space;The security of computer systems fundamentally relies on memory isolation, e.g., kernel address ranges are marked as non-accessible and are protected from user access. In this paper, we present Meltdown. Meltdown exploits side effects of out-of-order execution on modern processors to read arbitrary kernel-memory locations including personal data and passwords. Out-of-order execution is an indispensable performance feature and present in a wide range of modern processors. The attack is independent of the operating system, and it does not rely on any software vulnerabilities. Meltdown breaks all security guarantees provided by address space isolation as well as paravirtualized environments and, thus, every security mechanism building upon this foundation. On affected systems, Meltdown enables an adversary to read memory of other processes or virtual machines in the cloud without any permissions or privileges, affecting millions of customers and virtually every user of a personal computer.

By offering cloud capabilities at the network edge closer to mobile devices, edge computing is a promising paradigm to resolve several vital challenges in IoTs, such as bandwidth saturation, energy constraints, low latency transmission, and data security and privacy. To provide a comprehensive understanding of edge computing supported by the integration of IoTs and cloud computing, that is, CoTs, this article first discusses some distinct research directions in CoTs with respect to edge computing. Given the significance of energy efficiency and sustainability of edge deployment in CoTs, we put forward a green and sustainable virtual network embedding framework for cooperative edge computing in wireless-optical broadband access networks.

In this paper we consider a market where mobile network operators (MNOs) lease third-party deployed WiFi or femtocell access points (APs) to dynamically offload the traffic of their mobile users. We assume that each MNO can employ multiple APs and each AP can concurrently serve traffic from multiple MNOs. We design an iterative double auction mechanism that ensures the efficient operation of the market, where MNOs maximize their offloading benefits and APs minimize their offloading costs. Such a mechanism incorporates the special characteristics of the wireless network, such as the coupling of MNOs' offloading decisions and APs' capacity constraints. The proposed market scheme does not require full information about the MNOs and APs, incurs minimum communication overhead, and creates non-negative revenue for the market broker.;['1680329', '144614913', '143766909', '1705536'];['G.

6400c36efdb8a66b401b6aef26c057227266fddd;PointCNN: Convolution On X-Transformed Points;We present a simple and general framework for feature learning from point clouds. The key to the success of CNNs is the convolution operator that is capable of leveraging spatially-local correlation in data represented densely in grids (e.g. images). However, point clouds are irregular and unordered, thus directly convolving kernels against features associated with the points, will result in desertion of shape information and variance to point ordering. To address these problems, we propose to learn an $\mathcal{X}$-transformation from the input points, to simultaneously promote two causes. The first is the weighting of the input features associated with the points, and the second is the permutation of the points into a latent and potentially canonical order. Element-wise product and sum operations of the typical convolution operator are subsequently applied on the $\mathcal{X}$-transformed features. The proposed method is a generalization of typical CNNs to feature learning from point clouds, thus we;['1920864', '35526877', '71614496', '39533001', '7759488', '2028246830'];['Yangyan Li', 'Rui Bu', 'Mingchao Sun', 'Wei Wu', 'Xinhan Di', 'Baoquan Chen'];d9720b90-d60b-48bc-9df8-87a30b9a60dd;Neural Information Processing Systems;conference;5;2018.0;Houston;;;;;['Computer Science'];['7bbcd665f4847652e307ca717b209de92cd95dd2', 'b256e7155dd1a27ed9233aa4b47fd6334f5f243b', '04b54d8c4a327f143c3d00fc432740e1183f2337', '3a2823f29bb664ebcd8d440fc5b0952399c3aa10', '49b0b43e57dc8efe3a92f06ddcb5a7f39da4790d', '9ebdd272db2596f4f4bee741d6399363b2b6559f', '2a33d0939cb4f9200d401a453146bb120ee3b403', 'e1799aaf23c12af6932dc0ef3dfb1638f01413d1', '5eb4a5ac7faa2fc75e1739b45c511ba3fab5bb56', '7a2e527b6d51071a54aac7a8bdb56ca735a1f78b', '131660f9f10a831968f2fafa0985f1b5eeb0b337', '8674494bd7a076286b905912d26d47f7501c4046', 'f48d322244c906b45792b28206df7cfb23495004', 'a456265138c088a894301c0433dae938705a9bec', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba', 'f09f7888aa5aeaf88a2a44aea768d9a8747e97d2', '0e779fd59353a7f1f5b559b9d65fa4bfe367890c', '511ff60d4aa5ab2660552f02ee85692425912b46', '729d5c7dc6bfb32e47b5bd24cdb01ccaaf62bba5', '15ca7adccf5cd4dc309cdcaa6328f4c429ead337', '4cdcf2ae5e1fafebd9b3613247a7b1962584da34', 'a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8']

Such a surface representation is easy to learn from, but inhibits exploiting rich low-dimensional topological manifolds of the object shape due to lack of geometric connectivity. For benefiting from its simple structure yet utilizing rich neighborhood information across points, this paper proposes a two-stage cascade model on point sets. Specifically, our method adopts the state-of-the-art point set autoencoder to generate a sparsely coarse shape first, and then locally refines it by encoding neighborhood connectivity on a graph representation. An ensemble of sparse refined surface is designed to alleviate the suffering from local minima caused by modeling complex geometric manifolds. Moreover, our model develops a dynamically-weighted loss function for jointly penalizing the generation output of cascade levels at different training stages in a coarse-to-fine manner.

In its extended form, Anna is designed to overcome the narrow cost–performance limitations typical of current cloud storage systems. We describe three key aspects of Anna’s new design: multi-master selective replication of hot keys, a vertical tiering of storage layers with different cost–performance trade-offs, and horizontal elasticity of each tier to add and remove nodes in response to load dynamics. Anna’s policy engine uses these mechanisms to balance service-level objectives around cost, latency, and fault tolerance.

In this paper we present a simulation study for a cloud base station, which concentrates baseband processing functions of multiple radio sites.

Our simulation results show that the data traffic influences the variance of the compute resource utilization, which in consequence leads to significant multiplexing gains if multiple sectors are aggregated into one single cloud base station. In addition, the spatial user distribution has a high impact on the compute resource load.

In this work, we generalize the convolution operator from regular grids to arbitrary graphs while avoiding the spectral domain, which allows us to handle graphs of varying size and connectivity. To move beyond a simple diffusion, filter weights are conditioned on the specific edge labels in the neighborhood of a vertex. Together with the proper choice of graph coarsening, we explore constructing deep neural networks for graph classification. In particular, we demonstrate the generality of our formulation in point cloud classification, where we set the new state of the art, and on a graph classification dataset, where we outperform other deep learning approaches.;['3451689', '2505902'];['M.

In this paper, we address the problem of predicting future 3D LiDAR point clouds given a sequence of past LiDAR scans. Estimating the future scene on the sensor level does not require any preceding steps as in localization or tracking systems and can be trained self-supervised. We propose an end-to-end approach that exploits a 2D range image representation of each 3D LiDAR scan and concatenates a sequence of range images to obtain a 3D tensor. Based on such tensors, we develop an encoder-decoder architecture using 3D convolutions to jointly aggregate spatial and temporal information of the scene and to predict the future 3D point clouds.

Although the commonly used deconvolution networks (DeconvNet) have achieved impressive results on this task, we find there is still room for improvements in two aspects. One is about the boundary segmentation. DeconvNet aggregates large context to predict the label of each pixel, inherently limiting the segmentation precision of object boundaries. The other is about RGB-D fusion. Recent state-of-the-art methods generally fuse RGB and depth networks with equal-weight score fusion, regardless of the varying contributions of the two modalities on delineating different categories in different scenes. To address the two problems, we first propose a locality-sensitive DeconvNet (LS-DeconvNet) to refine the boundary segmentation over each modality. LS-DeconvNet incorporates locally visual and geometric cues from the raw RGB-D data into each DeconvNet, which is able to learn to upsample the coarse convolutional maps with large context whilst recovering sharp object boundaries.

In doing so, we reach a new state-of-the-art for end-to-end acoustic models decoded with an external language model in the standard supervised learning setting, and a new absolute state-of-the-art with semi-supervised training. Finally, we study the effect of leveraging different amounts of unlabeled audio, propose several ways of evaluating the characteristics of unlabeled audio which improve acoustic modeling, and show that acoustic models trained with more audio rely less on external language models.;['2282478', '17872416', '39960571', '3024698', '2256707284', '52555469', '8401284', '1680679', '2939803'];['Gabriel Synnaeve', 'Qiantong Xu', 'Jacob Kahn', 'Edouard Grave', 'Tatiana Likhomanenko', 'Vineel Pratap', 'Anuroop Sriram', 'Vitaliy Liptchinsky', 'R.

Recently, we witness two types of CNNs being developed: CNNs based upon volumetric representations versus CNNs based upon multi-view representations. Empirical results from these two types of CNNs exhibit a large gap, indicating that existing volumetric CNN architectures and approaches are unable to fully exploit the power of 3D representations. In this paper, we aim to improve both volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs according to extensive analysis of existing approaches. To this end, we introduce two distinct network architectures of volumetric CNNs. In addition, we examine multi-view CNNs, where we introduce multiresolution filtering in 3D. Overall, we are able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods for both volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs.

Previous work processes 3D data using either voxel-based or point-based NN models. However, both approaches are computationally inefficient. The computation cost and memory footprints of the voxel-based models grow cubically with the input resolution, making it memory-prohibitive to scale up the resolution. As for point-based networks, up to 80% of the time is wasted on structuring the irregular data which have rather poor memory locality, not on the actual feature extraction. In this paper, we propose PVCNN that represents the 3D input data in points to reduce the memory consumption, while performing the convolutions in voxels to largely reduce the irregular data access and improve the locality.

Previously, a main concern of Internet applications developers was deployment and hosting of applications, because it required acquisition of a server with a fixed capacity able to handle the expected application peak demand and the installation and maintenance of the whole software infrastructure of the platform supporting the application. Furthermore, server was underutilized because peak traffic happens only at specific times. With the advent of the Cloud, deployment and hosting became cheaper and easier with the use of pay-peruse flexible elastic infrastructure services offered by Cloud providers. Because several Cloud providers are available, each one offering different pricing models and located in different geographic regions, a new concern of application developers is selecting providers and data center locations for applications. However, there is a lack of tools that enable developers to evaluate requirements of large-scale Cloud applications;['2080635147', '145034579', '1709598'];['B. Wickremasinghe', 'R. Calheiros', 'R.

The proposed scheme is imbedded in the virtual USB drive architecture that replaces the NAND flash of the USB memory with the capacity-free network storage. The key of the proposed scheme is to perform onto the cloud storage log-structured writes with the optimal number of data blocks that adaptively changes with I/O characteristics (the number of I/O operations and storage size) and cloud storage pricing policy. The proposed scheme also efficiently manages associate metadata by using well-organized data structures and layouts both in the memory and on the cloud storage. Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme can reduce the total I/O costs significantly up to 54%, as compared with a simple one-to-one mapping scheme.;['2247813', '2110424707', '2108614666', '2446843'];['Y.

However, majority of Grid workflow systems either do not support Quality of Service (QoS), or provide only partial QoS support for certain phases of the workflow lifecycle. In this paper we present Amadeus, which is a holistic service‐oriented environment for QoS‐aware Grid workflows. Amadeus considers user requirements, in terms of QoS constraints, during workflow specification, planning, and execution. Within the Amadeus environment workflows and the associated QoS constraints are specified at a high level using an intuitive graphical notation. A distinguishing feature of our system is the support of a comprehensive set of QoS requirements, which considers in addition to performance and economical aspects also legal and security aspects. A set of QoS‐aware service‐oriented components is provided for workflow planning to support automatic constraint‐based service negotiation and workflow optimization.

This decentralized approach to train models provides privacy, security, regulatory and economic benefits. In this work, we focus on the statistical challenge of federated learning when local data is non-IID. We first show that the accuracy of federated learning reduces significantly, by up to 55% for neural networks trained for highly skewed non-IID data, where each client device trains only on a single class of data. We further show that this accuracy reduction can be explained by the weight divergence, which can be quantified by the earth mover's distance (EMD) between the distribution over classes on each device and the population distribution. As a solution, we propose a strategy to improve training on non-IID data by creating a small subset of data which;['2116811326', '49141099', '1891108', '40622167', '50986776', '144137038'];['Yue Zhao', 'Meng Li', 'Liangzhen Lai', 'Naveen Suda', 'Damon Civin', 'V.

Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.;['11126631', '40959192', '51012893', '1704657'];['T. Chen', 'Yulia Rubanova', 'J. Bettencourt', 'D.

While hand-designed features on point clouds have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent overwhelming success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. Point clouds inherently lack topological information, so designing a model to recover topology can enrich the representation power of point clouds. To this end, we propose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds, including classification and segmentation.

However, full exploitation of the cloud computing capabilities can be achieved only if the allocation of radio and computational capabilities is performed jointly. In this paper, we propose a method to jointly optimize the transmit power, the number of bits per symbol and the CPU cycles assigned to each application in order to minimize the power consumption at the mobile side, under an average latency constraint dictated by the application requirements. We consider the case of a set of mobile handsets served by a single cloud and we show that the optimization leads to a one-to-one relationship between the transmit power and the percentage of CPU cycles assigned to each user. Based on our optimization, we propose then a computation scheduling technique and verify the stability of the computations queue.;['1742301', '1716135', '35096879'];['S. Barbarossa', 'S.

Considering the local details of partial input with the global shape information together, we can preserve the existing details in the incomplete point set and generate the missing parts with high fidelity.

The exhaust is a source of cloud-condensation nuclei that increases the number of cloud droplets while reducing droplet size. This reduction in droplet size causes the reflectivity at 3.7 micrometers to be greater than the levels for nearby noncontaminated clouds of similar physical characteristics. The increase in droplet number causes the reflectivity at 0.63 micrometer to be significantly higher for the contaminated clouds despite the likelihood that the exhaust is a source of particles that absorb at visible wavelengths. The effect of aerosols on cloud reflectivity is expected to have a larger influence on the earth's albedo than that due to the direct scattering and absorption of sunlight by the aerosols alone.;['92042336', '32192655', '92364374'];['J.

To specify a framework, the creator must specify the different components that form the framework and how to instantiate them. Also, the communication interfaces between these various components must be defined. In this article, the authors propose such a framework based on the internet of things (IoT) for developing applications for handling emergencies of some kind. This article demonstrates the usage of the framework by explaining various applications such as tracking the status of autistic students, analytics on medical records to detect and mitigate chronic heart diseases in the Indian demographic, prediction of Parkinson's disease, determining the type of disease that corresponds to the dermatology field, and health monitoring and management using internet of things (IoT) sensing.;['2257224096', '2257232709', '2257242342'];['N.

9ab434ca694f2727293f3d82bd48782cecd4f577;Joint Resource Allocation for Latency-Sensitive Services Over Mobile Edge Computing Networks With Caching;Mobile edge computing (MEC) has risen as a promising paradigm to provide high quality of experience via relocating the cloud server in close proximity to smart mobile devices (SMDs). In MEC networks, the MEC server with computation capability and storage resource can jointly execute the latency-sensitive offloading tasks and cache the contents requested by SMDs. In order to minimize the total latency consumption of the computation tasks, we jointly consider computation offloading, content caching, and resource allocation as an integrated model, which is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. We design an asymmetric search tree and improve the branch and bound method to obtain a set of accurate decisions and resource allocation strategies. Furthermore, we introduce the auxiliary variables to reformulate the proposed model and apply the modified generalized benders decomposition method to solve the MINLP problem in polynomial computation complexity time. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority;['51181818', '1718919', '34506974', '1748459', '2116635305', '1721544', '2048628992', '2118094413', '143698682'];['Jiao Zhang', 'Xiping Hu', 'Zhaolong Ning', 'E.

This representation is commonly used for obstacle avoidance and mapping. Here, we propose a new approach for using point clouds for another critical robotic capability, semantic understanding of the environment (i.e., object classification). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), that perform extremely well for object classification in 2-D images, are not easily extendible to 3-D point clouds analysis. It is not straightforward due to point clouds’ irregular format and a varying number of points. The common solution of transforming the point cloud data into a 3-D voxel grid needs to address severe accuracy versus memory size tradeoffs. In this letter, we propose a novel, intuitively interpretable, 3-D point cloud representation called 3-D modified Fisher vectors. Our representation is hybrid as it combines a coarse discrete;['1410307807', '1727935', '1730818'];['Yizhak Ben-Shabat', 'M. Lindenbaum', 'A.

Despite the hype surrounding cloud computing, organizations are still reluctant to deploy their businesses in the cloud computing environment due to concerns in secure resource sharing. In this paper, we propose a cloud resource mediation service offered by cloud service providers, which plays the role of trusted third party among its different tenants. This paper formally specifies the resource sharing mechanism between two different tenants in the presence of our proposed cloud resource mediation service. The correctness of permission activation and delegation mechanism among different tenants using four distinct algorithms (activation, delegation, forward revocation, and backward revocation) is also demonstrated using formal verification. The performance analysis suggests that the sharing of resources can be performed securely and efficiently across different tenants of the cloud.;['2015250', '2952538', '2902894', '2840539', '3434250', '2109936162'];['Quratulain Alam', 'S.

In order to provide clients with cloud resources and satisfy their needs, cloud computing employs virtualization and resource provisioning techniques. The process of providing clients with shared virtualized resources (hardware, software, and platform) is a big challenge for the cloud provider because of over-provision and under-provision problems. Therefore, this paper highlighted some proposed approaches and scheduling algorithms applied for resource allocation within cloud computing through virtualization in the datacenter. The paper also aims to explore the role of virtualization in providing resources effectively based on clients’ requirements. The results of these approaches showed that each proposed approach and scheduling algorithm has an obvious role in utilizing the shared resources of the cloud data center.

To this end, we examine the trade-off between accuracy and speed for different architectures and additionally propose to use an L1 penalty on the filter activations to further encourage sparsity in the intermediate representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose sparse convolutional layers and L1 regularisation for efficient large-scale processing of 3D data.

However, they encode a particular sampling without accounting for shape priors or non-local information. We advocate for the use of a hierarchical Gaussian mixture model (hGMM), which is a compact, adaptive and lightweight representation that probabilistically defines the underlying 3D surface. We present PointGMM, a neural network that learns to generate hGMMs which are characteristic of the shape class, and also coincide with the input point cloud. PointGMM is trained over a collection of shapes to learn a class-specific prior. The hierarchical representation has two main advantages: (i) coarse-to-fine learning, which avoids converging to poor local-minima; and (ii) (an unsupervised) consistent partitioning of the input shape. We show that as a generative model, PointGMM learns a meaningful latent space which enables generating consistent interpolations between existing shapes, as well as synthesizing novel shapes.

In this work, we introduce a framework, FedProx, to tackle heterogeneity in federated networks. FedProx can be viewed as a generalization and re-parametrization of FedAvg, the current state-of-the-art method for federated learning. While this re-parameterization makes only minor modifications to the method itself, these modifications have important ramifications both in theory and in practice. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for our framework when learning over data from non-identical distributions (statistical heterogeneity), and while adhering to device-level systems constraints by allowing each participating device to perform a variable amount of work (systems heterogeneity).

2cd605106b88c85d7d8b865b1ef0f8c8293debf1;Zero-Shot Text-to-Image Generation;Text-to-image generation has traditionally focused on finding better modeling assumptions for training on a fixed dataset. These assumptions might involve complex architectures, auxiliary losses, or side information such as object part labels or segmentation masks supplied during training. We describe a simple approach for this task based on a transformer that autoregressively models the text and image tokens as a single stream of data. With sufficient data and scale, our approach is competitive with previous domain-specific models when evaluated in a zero-shot fashion.;['1992922591', '2068123790', '40087786', '145565184', '153387869', '38909097', '2108828435', '1701686'];['A.

5af2b332dceb6e8eebe33beb1b6264c66fa3e12d;The Architectural Implications of Cloud Microservices;Cloud services have recently undergone a shift from monolithic applications to microservices, with hundreds or thousands of loosely-coupled microservices comprising the end-to-end application. Microservices present both opportunities and challenges when optimizing for quality of service (QoS) and cloud utilization. In this paper we explore the implications cloud microservices have on system bottlenecks, and datacenter server design. We first present and characterize an end-to-end application built using tens of popular open-source microservices that implements a movie renting and streaming service, and is modular and extensible. We then use the end-to-end service to study the scalability and performance bottlenecks of microservices, and highlight implications they have on the design of datacenter hardware. Specifically, we revisit the long-standing debate of brawny versus wimpy cores in the context of microservices, we quantify the I-cache pressure they introduce, and measure the time spent in computation versus communication between microservices over RPCs.

de4754d75c5d2179f348c58a1108be9c1cbdf4a1;Fog Computing Based Face Identification and Resolution Scheme in Internet of Things;The identification and resolution technology are the prerequisite for realizing identity consistency of physical–cyber space mapping in the Internet of Things (IoT). Face, as a distinctive noncoded and unstructured identifier, has especial advantages in identification applications. With the increase of face identification based applications, the requirements for computation, communication, and storage capability are becoming higher and higher. To solve this problem, we propose a fog computing based face identification and resolution scheme. Face identifier is first generated by the identification system model to identify an individual. Then, a fog computing based resolution framework is proposed to efficiently resolve the individual's identity. Some computing overhead is offloaded from a cloud to network edge devices in order to improve processing efficiency and reduce network transmission. Finally, a prototype system based on local binary patterns (LBP) identifier is implemented to evaluate the scheme. Experimental results show that this scheme can effectively save bandwidth;['50466696', '52186545', '1962341', '2108183276', '144118283'];['Pengfei Hu', 'Huansheng Ning', 'Tie Qiu', 'Yanfei Zhang', 'Xiong Luo'];;;;;;;nw52cagi;IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics;2017.0;13;['Computer Science'];[]

bf2793fc09176f8bf23b3a2b3c6b32185e8a8329;Multi-level Fusion Based 3D Object Detection from Monocular Images;In this paper, we present an end-to-end multi-level fusion based framework for 3D object detection from a single monocular image. The whole network is composed of two parts: one for 2D region proposal generation and another for simultaneously predictions of objects' 2D locations, orientations, dimensions, and 3D locations. With the help of a stand-alone module to estimate the disparity and compute the 3D point cloud, we introduce the multi-level fusion scheme. First, we encode the disparity information with a front view feature representation and fuse it with the RGB image to enhance the input. Second, features extracted from the original input and the point cloud are combined to boost the object detection. For 3D localization, we introduce an extra stream to predict the location information from point cloud directly and add it to the aforementioned location prediction. The proposed algorithm can directly output both 2D and 3D object detection results;['2113742695', '48354614'];['Bin Xu', 'Zhenzhong Chen'];;;;;;;elb5qdny;2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition;2018.0;31;['Computer Science'];['79cfb51a51fc093f66aac8e858afe2e14d4a1f20', '7d39d69b23424446f0400ef603b2e3e22d0309d6', 'dc200ab22bf63e10e8b2af328a9e072d82cf75b7', 'd821767b7c7315c69daa39fbb0f4a44426bfaf41']

To achieve state-of-the-art performance for multi-class 3D point cloud generation, a tree-structured graph convolution network (TreeGCN) is introduced as a generator for tree-GAN. Because TreeGCN performs graph convolutions within a tree, it can use ancestor information to boost the representation power for features. To evaluate GANs for 3D point clouds accurately, we develop a novel evaluation metric called Fr\'echet point cloud distance (FPD). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tree-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art GANs in terms of both conventional metrics and FPD, and can generate point clouds for different semantic parts without prior knowledge.;['153913087', '2115276875', '2110140'];['Dong Wook Shu', 'Sung Woo Park', 'Junseok Kwon'];7654260e-79f9-45c5-9663-d72027cf88f3;IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision;conference;9;2019.0;Paris;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['32b918246037976ba5f8363104ec042f56db42d6', '52afbe99de04878a5ac73a4adad4b1cedae8a6ce', 'e1799aaf23c12af6932dc0ef3dfb1638f01413d1', '572a5aa00f0569887469ffb7554699c21156ba0b', '80f5ee8578ee76e2c17824f211762ffec7e029d4', 'b3159fd22e19e24d7cde9d37b3e482b832d4fa58', '8674494bd7a076286b905912d26d47f7501c4046', 'f48d322244c906b45792b28206df7cfb23495004', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba', '41d08fb733f3e50ac183490f84d6377dffccf350', '76cee11c6a9f1424f03571378a966c1417ff2935', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '15ca7adccf5cd4dc309cdcaa6328f4c429ead337', '23ffaa0fe06eae05817f527a47ac3291077f9e58', '492f57ee9ceb61fb5a47ad7aebfec1121887a175', '5d1bfeed240709725c78bc72ea40e55410b373dc']

Within MHSNs, patients can use their mobile devices to securely share their experiences, broaden their understanding of the illness or symptoms, form a supportive network, and transmit information (e.g., state of health and new symptoms) between users and other stake holders (e.g., medical center). Despite the benefits afforded by MHSNs, there are underlying security and privacy issues (e.g., due to the transmission of messages via a wireless channel). The handshake scheme is an important cryptographic mechanism, which can provide secure communication in MHSNs (e.g., anonymity and mutual authentication between users, such as patients). In this paper, we present a new framework for the handshake scheme in MHSNs, which is based on hierarchical identity-based cryptography.

Wishbone uses profiling to determine how each operator in the dataflow graph will actually perform on sample data, without requiring cumbersome user annotations.

8afa6dd9f9ac46462a1fb70a757c4ae1cd45bbf6;FFJORD: Free-form Continuous Dynamics for Scalable Reversible Generative Models;A promising class of generative models maps points from a simple distribution to a complex distribution through an invertible neural network. Likelihood-based training of these models requires restricting their architectures to allow cheap computation of Jacobian determinants. Alternatively, the Jacobian trace can be used if the transformation is specified by an ordinary differential equation. In this paper, we use Hutchinson's trace estimator to give a scalable unbiased estimate of the log-density. The result is a continuous-time invertible generative model with unbiased density estimation and one-pass sampling, while allowing unrestricted neural network architectures. We demonstrate our approach on high-dimensional density estimation, image generation, and variational inference, achieving the state-of-the-art among exact likelihood methods with efficient sampling.;['7649077', '51466615', '51012893', '1701686', '1704657'];['Will Grathwohl', 'Ricky T.

2d69a1517bed9578b0a7a08fe5ecb68fe0a2f71c;Searchable Symmetric Encryption;Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) when deployed in the cloud allows one to query encrypted data without the risk of data leakage. Despite the widespread interest, existing surveys do not examine in detail how SSE’s underlying structures are designed and how these result in the many properties of a SSE scheme. This is the gap we seek to address, as well as presenting recent state-of-the-art advances on SSE. Specifically, we present a general framework and believe the discussions may lead to insights for potential new designs. We draw a few observations. First, most schemes use index table, where optimal index size and sublinear search can be achieved using an inverted index. Straightforward updating can only be achieved using direct index, but search time would be linear. A recent trend is the combinations of index table, and tree, deployed for efficient updating and storage. Secondly, mechanisms from related fields such as Oblivious;['2027194', '36518687', '39064092', '116022805', '33570647'];['G. Poh', 'Ji-Jian Chin', 'Wei‐Chuen Yau', 'K.

We base our theory on results simulated from a one-dimensional climate model with an interactive cloud formation and precipitation program. This cloud program includes temperature-dependent parameterization equations for condensation, evaporation, and precipitation derived from growth equations for water droplets. We show that the cloud liquid water content is directly related to precipitation processes, which are governed by the mean cloud particle radius. In particular, we illustrate that the rate of precipitation generation is directly proportional to the fourth power of this radius. A doubling of CO2 is used as the radiative forcing. If the perturbed mean cloud particle radii for model high, middle, and low clouds are less than the climatological mean values, precipitation decreases because of the presence of smaller cloud particles, leading to an increase in the cloud liquid water content.

In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end network for robust point clouds processing, named PointASNL, which can deal with point clouds with noise effectively. The key component in our approach is the adaptive sampling (AS) module. It first re-weights the neighbors around the initial sampled points from farthest point sampling (FPS), and then adaptively adjusts the sampled points beyond the entire point cloud. Our AS module can not only benefit the feature learning of point clouds, but also ease the biased effect of outliers. To further capture the neighbor and long-range dependencies of the sampled point, we proposed a local-nonlocal (L-NL) module inspired by the nonlocal operation. Such L-NL module enables the learning process insensitive to noise. Extensive experiments verify the robustness and superiority of our approach in point clouds processing tasks;['2144474491', '152142790', '49969637', '2151484838', '1745056'];['Xu Yan', 'Chaoda Zheng', 'Zhuguo Li', 'Sheng Wang', 'Shuguang Cui'];768b87bb-8a18-4d9c-a161-4d483c776bcf;Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition;conference;8;2020.0;São Paulo;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Cloud', 'Neural Networks'];['3d7df210adf70f30f952739553201994b92e5630', 'a58715797b61588cbd020b9a98292a98f8483420', '7ce6eca495909de2ffa0b6d9c16993757208764e', 'd33949030c7be933ee83768e4dfa1ed387cdc12b', '2c2d7daabd764f981950b71230e3ac96a0d21984', '7bbcd665f4847652e307ca717b209de92cd95dd2', 'b256e7155dd1a27ed9233aa4b47fd6334f5f243b', 'e81acd4f35eb2202bf753266ec83d3174645820f', '04b54d8c4a327f143c3d00fc432740e1183f2337', '3a2823f29bb664ebcd8d440fc5b0952399c3aa10', '49b0b43e57dc8efe3a92f06ddcb5a7f39da4790d', '9ebdd272db2596f4f4bee741d6399363b2b6559f', '2a33d0939cb4f9200d401a453146bb120ee3b403', 'e1799aaf23c12af6932dc0ef3dfb1638f01413d1', '6400c36efdb8a66b401b6aef26c057227266fddd', '5eb4a5ac7faa2fc75e1739b45c511ba3fab5bb56', '7a2e527b6d51071a54aac7a8bdb56ca735a1f78b', '204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776', '8674494bd7a076286b905912d26d47f7501c4046', '1a39bb2caa151d15efd6718f3a80d9f4bff95af2', 'f48d322244c906b45792b28206df7cfb23495004', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba', '511ff60d4aa5ab2660552f02ee85692425912b46', '729d5c7dc6bfb32e47b5bd24cdb01ccaaf62bba5', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d']

We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves;['39358728', '2118223312', '67215934', '1697700', '49178343', '1793529'];['Yongming Rao', 'Wenliang Zhao', 'Benlin Liu', 'Jiwen Lu', 'Jie Zhou', 'Cho-Jui Hsieh'];d9720b90-d60b-48bc-9df8-87a30b9a60dd;Neural Information Processing Systems;conference;12;2021.0;Barcelona;;;;;['Computer Science'];['80da612e1831b8c11539180871843cff6dfaac90', 'dbe077f8521ecbe0a1477d6148c726d4f053d9c9', 'ad7ddcc14984caae308c397f1a589aae75d4ab71', '268d347e8a55b5eb82fb5e7d2f800e33c75ab18a', '962dc29fdc3fbdc5930a10aba114050b82fe5a3e', '204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d']

By exploiting the powerful CCS capabilities of PoCs, DART brings both communication and computing services much closer to end devices so that resource-constrained IoT devices could have access to the desired communication and computing services. To achieve the design goals of DART, we further study the spectrum-aware placement of edge computing services. We formulate the service placement as a stochastic mixed-integer optimization problem and propose an enhanced coarse-grained fixing procedure to facilitate efficient solution finding. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting spectrum-aware service placement strategies and the proposed solution approach.;['2649982', '1795475', '3106778', '145826200'];['Haichuan Ding', 'Yuanxiong Guo', 'Xuanheng Li', 'Yuguang Fang'];;;;;;;ejbqciaw;IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing;2019.0;18;['Computer Science'];[]

Furthermore, based on theoretical calculations and network simulations we present considerations on deployment scenarios to optimize green field deployments in terms of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

One concept being challenged by new technologies is fixed pricing, which became prevalent in western society during the industrial revolution when mass production and widespread delivery of goods made price negotiation impractical.

39c34713fe6503c3782cabbdf72ebeb7fc9bcafa;VoxSegNet: Volumetric CNNs for Semantic Part Segmentation of 3D Shapes;Volumetric representation has been widely used for 3D deep learning in shape analysis due to its generalization ability and regular data format. However, for fine-grained tasks like part segmentation, volumetric data has not been widely adopted compared to other representations. Aiming at delivering an effective volumetric method for 3D shape part segmentation, this paper proposes a novel volumetric convolutional neural network. Our method can extract discriminative features encoding detailed information from voxelized 3D data under limited resolution. To this purpose, a spatial dense extraction (SDE) module is designed to preserve spatial resolution during feature extraction procedure, alleviating the loss of details caused by sub-sampling operations such as max pooling. An attention feature aggregation (AFA) module is also introduced to adaptively select informative features from different abstraction levels, leading to segmentation with both semantic consistency and high accuracy of details.

Training and evaluating methods purely in simulation is often “doomed to succeed” at the desired task in a simulated environment, but the resulting models are incapable of operation in the real world. Here we present and evaluate a method for transferring a vision-based lane following driving policy from simulation to operation on a rural road without any real-world labels. Our approach leverages recent advances in image-to-image translation to achieve domain transfer while jointly learning a single-camera control policy from simulation control labels. We assess the driving performance of this method using both open-loop regression metrics, and closed-loop performance operating an autonomous vehicle on rural and urban roads.;['2330315778', '1792070523', None, '40119481', '2066594564', '51118365', '47645184'];['Alex Bewley', 'J.

Resource management of virtualized servers is an important and challenging task, especially when dealing with fluctuating workloads and complex multi-tier server applications. Recent results in control theory-based resource management have shown the potential benefits of adjusting allocations to match changing workloads. This paper presents a new resource management scheme that integrates the Kalman filter into feedback controllers to dynamically allocate CPU resources to virtual machines hosting server applications. The novelty of our approach is the use of the Kalman filter-the optimal filtering technique for state estimation in the sum of squares sense-to track the CPU utilizations and update the allocations accordingly. Our basic controllers continuously detect and self-adapt to unforeseen workload intensity changes. Our more advanced controller self-configures itself to any workload condition without any a priori information. Indicatively, it results in within 4.8%;['2129419', '49638807', '38424357'];['Evangelia Kalyvianaki', 'Themistoklis Charalambous', 'S.

It is an open question how future server architectures should evolve to enable this emerging class of applications, and the lack of an open-source IPA workload is an obstacle in addressing this question. In this paper, we present the design of Sirius, an open end-to-end IPA web-service application that accepts queries in the form of voice and images, and responds with natural language. We then use this workload to investigate the implications of four points in the design space of future accelerator-based server architectures spanning traditional CPUs, GPUs, manycore throughput co-processors, and FPGAs. To investigate future server designs for Sirius, we decompose Sirius into a suite of 7 benchmarks (Sirius Suite) comprising the computationally intensive bottlenecks of Sirius.

In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds, which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. Our network, named PointNet, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, PointNet is highly efficient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art.

Moreover, smartphones are often used for privacy-sensitive tasks, becoming highly valuable targets for attackers. They are also quite different from PCs, so that PC-oriented solutions are not always applicable, or do not offer comprehensive security. We propose an alternative solution, where security checks are applied on remote security servers that host exact replicas of the phones in virtual environments. The servers are not subject to the same constraints, allowing us to apply multiple detection techniques simultaneously. We implemented a prototype of this security model for Android phones, and show that it is both practical and scalable: we generate no more than 2KiB/s and 64B/s of trace data for high-loads and idle operation respectively, and are able to support more than a hundred replicas running on a single server.;['1685559', '144373328', '1793306', '144783720'];['G.

Services, such as Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's EC2, allow users to instantiate virtual machines (VMs) on demand and thus purchase precisely the capacity they require when they require it. In turn, the use of virtualization allows third-party cloud providers to maximize the utilization of their sunk capital costs by multiplexing many customer VMs across a shared physical infrastructure. However, in this paper, we show that this approach can also introduce new vulnerabilities. Using the Amazon EC2 service as a case study, we show that it is possible to map the internal cloud infrastructure, identify where a particular target VM is likely to reside, and then instantiate new VMs until one is placed co-resident with the target. We explore how such placement can then be used to mount cross-VM side-channel attacks to extract information from a target VM on;['1707461', '2337345', '1786752', '1727599'];['Thomas Ristenpart', 'Eran Tromer', 'H.

4fbb1530b79432d1783017fd393c096eaebc809f;Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds Based on High Precision Range Search Network;Semantic segmentation for 3D point clouds plays a critical role in the construction of 3D models. Due to the sparse and disordered natures of the point clouds, semantic segmentation of such unstructured data yields technical challenges. A recently proposed deep neural network, PointNet, delivers attractive semantic segmentation performance, but it only exploits the global features of point clouds without incorporating any local features, limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns. For that, this paper proposes a deeper hierarchical structure called the high precision range search (HPRS) network, which can learn local features with increasing contextual scales. We develop an adaptive ball query algorithm that designs a comprehensive set of grouping strategies. It can gather detailed local feature points in comparison to the common ball query algorithm, especially when there are not enough feature points within the ball range.

It is generally agreed that the only possible solution to overcome the current limitations is to deploy very dense and heterogeneous wireless networks, which we call DenseNets. However, simply scaling down existing networks by orders of magnitude, as required to fulfill traffic forecasts, is not possible because of the following constraints: i) the bottleneck would shift from the Radio Access Network (RAN) to the backhaul, ii) control overhead, especially related to mobility management, would make the network collapse, iii) operational costs of the network would be unbearable due to energy consumption and maintenance/optimisation.

The present work introduces a novel method for the automated diagnosis and detection of metastases from whole slide images using the Fast AI framework and the 1-cycle policy.

In this work, we introduce a general method for 3D self-supervised representation learning that 1) remains agnostic to the underlying neural network architecture, and 2) specifically leverages the geometric nature of 3D point cloud data. The proposed task softly segments 3D points into a discrete number of geometric partitions. A self-supervised loss is formed under the interpretation that these soft partitions implicitly parameterize a latent Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and that this generative model establishes a data likelihood function. Our pretext task can therefore be viewed in terms of an encoder-decoder paradigm that squeezes learned representations through an implicitly defined parametric discrete generative model bottleneck. We show that any existing neural network architecture designed for supervised point cloud segmentation can be repurposed for the proposed unsupervised pretext task.

In particular, learning predictive models of videos offers an especially appealing mechanism to enable a rich understanding of the physical world: videos of real-world interactions are plentiful and readily available, and a model that can predict future video frames can not only capture useful representations of the world, but can be useful in its own right, for problems such as model-based robotic control. However, a central challenge in video prediction is that the future is highly uncertain: a sequence of past observations of events can imply many possible futures. Although a number of recent works have studied probabilistic models that can represent uncertain futures, such models are either extremely expensive computationally (as in the case of pixel-level autoregressive models), or do not directly optimize the likelihood;['2157851439', '3365707', '1761978', '46881670', '1736651', '46573521', '70429380'];['Manoj Kumar', 'M.

In this paper, we look at geometric data represented as point clouds. We introduce a deep AutoEncoder (AE) network with state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and generalization ability. The learned representations outperform existing methods on 3D recognition tasks and enable shape editing via simple algebraic manipulations, such as semantic part editing, shape analogies and shape interpolation, as well as shape completion. We perform a thorough study of different generative models including GANs operating on the raw point clouds, significantly improved GANs trained in the fixed latent space of our AEs, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). To quantitatively evaluate generative models we introduce measures of sample fidelity and diversity based on matchings between sets of point clouds. Interestingly, our evaluation of generalization, fidelity and diversity reveals that GMMs trained in the latent space of our AEs yield the best;['22199114', '1868022', '3168518', '51352814'];['Panos Achlioptas', 'Olga Diamanti', 'Ioannis Mitliagkas', 'L.

In this paper, we consider selfish mobile devices in a dense wireless network, in which individual mobile devices can offload computations through multiple access points or through the base station to a mobile cloud so as to minimize their computation costs. We provide a game theoretical analysis of the problem, prove the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria, and provide an efficient decentralized algorithm for computing an equilibrium. For the case when the cloud computing resources scale with the number of mobile devices, we show that all improvement paths are finite. Furthermore, we provide an upper bound on the price of anarchy of the game, which serves as an upper bound on the approximation ratio of the proposed decentralized algorithms. We use simulations to evaluate the time complexity of computing Nash equilibria;['3124970', '143996776'];['Sladana Jošilo', 'G.

However, there are several classes of services for which the current cloud model may not fit well: some do not need strong performance guarantees, the pricing may be too expensive for some, and some may be constrained by the data movement costs to the cloud. To satisfy the requirements of such services, we propose the idea of using distributed voluntary resources--those donated by end-user hosts--to form nebulas: more dispersed, less-managed clouds. We first discuss the requirements of cloud services and the challenges in meeting these requirements in such voluntary clouds. We then present some possible solutions to these challenges and also discuss opportunities for further improvements to make nebulas a viable cloud paradigm.;['144114650', '1750436'];['A.

It provides a runtime environment and a set of APIs that allow developers to build .NET applications that leverage their computation on either public or private clouds. One of the key features of Aneka is the ability of supporting multiple programming models that are ways of expressing the execution logic of applications by using specific abstractions. This is accomplished by creating a customizable and extensible service oriented runtime environment represented by a collection of software containers connected together. By leveraging on these architecture advanced services including resource reservation, persistence, storage management, security, and performance monitoring have been implemented. On top of this infrastructure different programming models can be plugged to provide support for different scenarios as demonstrated by the engineering, life science, and industry applications.;['1801870', '2282967120', '1709598'];['C.

An FC node is available in closer proximity to users and extends cloud services to the edge of the network in a highly distributed manner. However, with an increase in streaming and delay-sensitive Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, FC also needs to address the issue of higher latency while forwarding compute-intensive jobs to remote cloud data centers. Hence, there is a need to investigate the use of computational resources at the edge of the network. Volunteer computing (VC) offers a reduction in the cost of maintaining high-performance computing by making use of user-owned underutilized or idle resources, e.g., laptops and desktop computers closer to fog devices. We propose volunteer-supported FC (VSFC), as a computing paradigm, that explores the interplay of these two distributed computing domains to help minimize inherent communication delays of cloud computing, energy consumption, and network;['100694334', '2051541390', '39495736', '72482218', '1709598'];['Babar Ali', 'Muhammad Adeel Pasha', 'Saif ul Islam', 'H.

Data;Federated learning allows multiple parties to jointly train a deep learning model on their combined data, without any of the participants having to reveal their local data to a centralized server. This form of privacy-preserving collaborative learning, however, comes at the cost of a significant communication overhead during training. To address this problem, several compression methods have been proposed in the distributed training literature that can reduce the amount of required communication by up to three orders of magnitude. These existing methods, however, are only of limited utility in the federated learning setting, as they either only compress the upstream communication from the clients to the server (leaving the downstream communication uncompressed) or only perform well under idealized conditions, such as i.i.d. distribution of the client data, which typically cannot be found in federated learning.

To this end, this work elaborates on the design, the development and the comparative evaluation with other similar models, as well as with real-time comparisons through emulators, of a process-offloading scheme that is based on a mobile opportunistic cloud computing approach. According to the proposed approach, each mobile device with access to interactive -delay sensitive- multimedia content (i.e. online gaming with processing power requirements) exploits several network-centric parameters, by using Nano-Mobile Data Centers for an interactive, collaborative and real-time manipulation of the available resources.

This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks.

Moreover, it enables new applications such as part interpolation and replacement.;['2151270116', '2355828', '10274707', '2266326'];['Yongheng Zhao', 'Tolga Birdal', 'Haowen Deng', 'Federico Tombari'];768b87bb-8a18-4d9c-a161-4d483c776bcf;Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition;conference;12;2018.0;Paris;;;;;['Computer Science'];['8ca14e5107ab49aea72e884b033ea6fb13c1e547', '2c2d7daabd764f981950b71230e3ac96a0d21984', 'b256e7155dd1a27ed9233aa4b47fd6334f5f243b', '49b0b43e57dc8efe3a92f06ddcb5a7f39da4790d', '840e804bb5ed1944e494959c2980a90bea0675c4', 'e1799aaf23c12af6932dc0ef3dfb1638f01413d1', '572a5aa00f0569887469ffb7554699c21156ba0b', '80f5ee8578ee76e2c17824f211762ffec7e029d4', 'b3159fd22e19e24d7cde9d37b3e482b832d4fa58', '8674494bd7a076286b905912d26d47f7501c4046', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba', '511ff60d4aa5ab2660552f02ee85692425912b46', '729d5c7dc6bfb32e47b5bd24cdb01ccaaf62bba5', '76cee11c6a9f1424f03571378a966c1417ff2935']

Unlike image and video processing, however, geometry processing requires handling unstructured geometric data, and thus data representation becomes an important challenge in this framework. Existing approaches tackle this challenge by converting point clouds, meshes, or polygon soups into regular representations using, e.g., multi‐view images, volumetric grids or planar parameterizations. In each of these cases, geometric data representation is treated as a fixed pre‐process that is largely disconnected from the machine learning tool. In contrast, we propose to optimize for the geometric representation during the network learning process using a novel metric alignment layer. Our approach maps unstructured geometric data to a regular domain by minimizing the metric distortion of the map using the regularized Gromov–Wasserstein objective. This objective is parameterized by the metric of the target domain and is differentiable; thus, it can be easily";['1410529269', '1932072', '3082383', '1398681470'];['Danielle Ezuz', 'J.

Trends in multi-core processors, end-host virtualization, and commodities of scale are pointing to future single-site data centers with millions of virtual end points. Existing layer 2 and layer 3 network protocols face some combination of limitations in such a setting: lack of scalability, difficult management, inflexible communication, or limited support for virtual machine migration. To some extent, these limitations may be inherent for Ethernet/IP style protocols when trying to support arbitrary topologies. We observe that data center networks are often managed as a single logical network fabric with a known baseline topology and growth model. We leverage this observation in the design and implementation of PortLand, a scalable, fault tolerant layer 2 routing and forwarding protocol for data center environments.

We propose Multi-View 3D networks (MV3D), a sensory-fusion framework that takes both LIDAR point cloud and RGB images as input and predicts oriented 3D bounding boxes. We encode the sparse 3D point cloud with a compact multi-view representation. The network is composed of two subnetworks: one for 3D object proposal generation and another for multi-view feature fusion. The proposal network generates 3D candidate boxes efficiently from the birds eye view representation of 3D point cloud. We design a deep fusion scheme to combine region-wise features from multiple views and enable interactions between intermediate layers of different paths. Experiments on the challenging KITTI benchmark show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by around 25% and 30% AP on the tasks of 3D localization and 3D detection.

Often a set of such experiments is required-- perhaps with different server configurations or workload parameters--to obtain a statistically sound result for a given benchmarking objective. This paper explores a framework and policies to conduct such benchmarking activities automatically and efficiently. The workbench automation framework is designed to be independent of the underlying benchmark harness, including the server implementation, configuration tools, and workload generator. Rather, we take those mechanisms as given and focus on automation policies within the framework. As a motivating example we focus on rating the peak load of an NFS file server for a given set of workload parameters, a common and costly activity in the storage server industry.

344c84951ec0d7f40784168fb91a3ee829994a81;Turbulent Mixing, Spectral Evolution and Dynamics in a Warm Cumulus Cloud;Abstract The analysis of Paluch suggests that some cumuli contain cloudy air from only two sources: cloud base and cloud top. A framework is presented for the investigation of droplet spectral evolution in clouds composed of air from only these two sources. The key is the investigation of the dependence of droplet concentration N on the fraction of cloud base air F in a sample of cloudy air. This N-vs-F analysis is coupled with an investigation of droplet spectral parameters to infer the types and scales of entrainment and mixing events. The technique is used in a case study of a small, nonprecipitating continental cumulus cloud which was sampled during the 1981 CCOPE project in eastern Montana. The mixing between cloudy and entrained air in this cloud often appears to occur without total removal of droplets, although there is evidence that total evaporation occurs in some regions with low liquid;['145915235', '50055904', '47052215', '38779747'];['J.

79cfb51a51fc093f66aac8e858afe2e14d4a1f20;Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection;The highest accuracy object detectors to date are based on a two-stage approach popularized by R-CNN, where a classifier is applied to a sparse set of candidate object locations. In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training.

1335190de78e0b58fbf7a7c7c52fa1a15f14858a;Learning 3D Shape Completion from Laser Scan Data with Weak Supervision;3D shape completion from partial point clouds is a fundamental problem in computer vision and computer graphics. Recent approaches can be characterized as either data-driven or learning-based. Data-driven approaches rely on a shape model whose parameters are optimized to fit the observations. Learning-based approaches, in contrast, avoid the expensive optimization step and instead directly predict the complete shape from the incomplete observations using deep neural networks. However, full supervision is required which is often not available in practice. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised learning-based approach to 3D shape completion which neither requires slow optimization nor direct supervision. While we also learn a shape prior on synthetic data, we amortize, i.e., learn, maximum likelihood fitting using deep neural networks resulting in efficient shape completion without sacrificing accuracy. Tackling 3D shape completion of cars on ShapeNet [5] and KITTI [18], we demonstrate that the proposed amortized maximum likelihood approach is;['145177088', '47237027'];['David Stutz', 'Andreas Geiger'];;;;;;;do7b7sqi;2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition;2018.0;17;['Computer Science'];['41d08fb733f3e50ac183490f84d6377dffccf350', '76cee11c6a9f1424f03571378a966c1417ff2935', '87c757138d273ccd38216ca5266406a503507077']

Speed is critical as detection is a necessary component for safety. Existing approaches are, however, expensive in computation due to high dimensionality of point clouds. We utilize the 3D data more efficiently by representing the scene from the Bird's Eye View (BEV), and propose PIXOR, a proposal-free, single-stage detector that outputs oriented 3D object estimates decoded from pixel-wise neural network predictions. The input representation, network architecture, and model optimization are specially designed to balance high accuracy and real-time efficiency. We validate PIXOR on two datasets: the KITTI BEV object detection benchmark, and a large-scale 3D vehicle detection benchmark. In both datasets we show that the proposed detector surpasses other state-of-the-art methods notably in terms of Average Precision (AP), while still runs at 10 FPS.;['49188662', '49756115', '2422559'];['Binh Yang', 'Wenjie Luo', 'R.

This requires the high-level semantic features should be as much alike as possible among samples. To achive this, previous works focus on re-designing the loss or proposing new regularization constraints. In this paper, we provide a new perspective. For each category, it is assumed that there are two feature sets: one with reliable information and the other with less reliable source. We argue that the reliable set could guide the feature learning of the less reliable set during training - in spirit of student mimicking teacher behavior and thus pushing towards a more compact class centroid in the feature space. Such a scheme also benefits the reliable set since samples become closer within the same category - implying that it is easier for the classifier to identify. We refer to this mutual learning process as feature intertwiner;['46382329', '144445937', '2072683588', '3001348', '93768810'];['Hongyang Li', 'Bo Dai', 'Shaoshuai Shi', 'Wanli Ouyang', 'Xiaogang Wang'];939c6e1d-0d17-4d6e-8a82-66d960df0e40;International Conference on Learning Representations;conference;9;2019.0;New York;;;;;['Computer Science'];['7ce6eca495909de2ffa0b6d9c16993757208764e', '79cfb51a51fc093f66aac8e858afe2e14d4a1f20', '0d57ba12a6d958e178d83be4c84513f7e42b24e5', '7d39d69b23424446f0400ef603b2e3e22d0309d6', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d']

However, depending on application characteristics, those structures do not always provide (much) performance benefit. While timeout-based power gating techniques have been leveraged for underutilized cores and inactive functional units, these techniques have not directly translated to high-activity units such as vector processing units, complex branch predictors, and caches. The performance benefit provided by these units does not necessarily correspond with unit activity, but instead is a function of application characteristics. This work introduces PowerChop, a novel technique that leverages the unique capabilities of HW/SW co-designed hybrid processors to enact unit-level power management at the application phase level. PowerChop adds two small additional hardware units to facilitate phase identification and triggering different power states, enabling the software layer to cheaply track, predict and take advantage of varying unit criticality across application phases by powering gating units that are not needed;['2672197', '3216153', '2108312079', '2235128', '144603405'];['M.

This development forces companies to drive new strategies such as service differentiation, coopetition and engaging into dynamic service ecosystems. Traditional ideas of static value chains give way to agile service value networks where many decentralized service providers compete and cooperate in the creation of value added mashed-up services. Nevertheless, there is a lack of efficient ways to design service mashups considering service configurations, interrelations and incompatibilities. There is a necessity to foster flexible allocation of sub-services and dynamic pricing. Currently, services are mostly charged statically via flat fees or pay-per-use prices. This is controversial because especially in short-living environments as service markets, there is a great demand for mechanisms providing dynamic sub-service reallocation and overall price determination.

Though convolution is clearly defined for structured data such as 2D images or 3D volumes, this is not true for other data types such as sparse point clouds. Previous techniques have developed approximations to convolutions for restricted conditions. Unfortunately, their applicability is limited and cannot be used for general point clouds. We propose an efficient and effective method to learn convolutions for non-uniformly sampled point clouds, as they are obtained with modern acquisition techniques. Learning is enabled by four key novelties: first, representing the convolution kernel itself as a multilayer perceptron; second, phrasing convolution as a Monte Carlo integration problem, third, using this notion to combine information from multiple samplings at different levels; and fourth using Poisson disk sampling as a scalable means of hierarchical point cloud learning.

Together with Cloud computing, they represent a stacked architecture, in which raw datasets are first pre-processed locally at the Edge and then vertically offloaded to the Fog and/or the Cloud. However, as hardware is becoming increasingly powerful, Edge devices are seen as candidates for offering data processing capabilities, able to pool and share computing resources to achieve better performance at a lower network latency—a pattern that can be also applied to Fog nodes. In these circumstances, it is important to enable efficient, intelligent, and balanced allocation of resources, as well as their further orchestration, in an elastic and transparent manner.

In this paper, we modify their mathematical expressions and perform a rigorous analysis on their robustness and complexity for the problem of 3D registration for overlapping point cloud views. More concretely, we present several optimizations that reduce their computation times drastically by either caching previously computed values or by revising their theoretical formulations. The latter results in a new type of local features, called Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH), which retain most of the discriminative power of the PFH. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for the online computation of FPFH features for realtime applications. To validate our results we demonstrate their efficiency for 3D registration and propose a new sample consensus based method for bringing two datasets into the convergence;['2689311', '1810221', '1746229'];['R.

It is well known that the diurnal user access pattern of user-facing services provides a strong incentive to co-locate applications for better accelerator utilization and efficiency, and prior work has focused on enabling co-location on multicore processors. However, interference when co-locating applications on non-preemptive accelerators is fundamentally different than contention on multi-core CPUs and introduces a new set of challenges to reduce QoS violation. To address this open problem, we first identify the underlying causes for QoS violation in accelerator-outfitted servers. Our experiments show that queuing delay for the compute resources and PCI-e bandwidth contention for data transfer are the main two factors that contribute to the long tails of user-facing applications.

Therefore, we present an architecture for cluster services in which the deployed services overcome this problem by actively participating in any action taken by the power management.

However, this growth comes at the cost of an increasing thermal load that must be removed to prevent overheating and server failure. In this paper, we propose to use phase changing materials (PCM) to shape the thermal load of a datacenter, absorbing and releasing heat when it is advantageous to do so. We present and validate a methodology to study the impact of PCM on a datacenter, and evaluate two important opportunities for cost savings. We find that in a datacenter with full cooling system subscription, PCM can reduce the necessary cooling system size by up to 12% without impacting peak throughput, or increase the number of servers by up to 14.6% without increasing the cooling load. In a thermally constrained setting, PCM can increase peak throughput up to 69% while delaying the onset of thermal limits;['49592737', '2055667275', '2496402', '2118912473', '1740142', '2235128', '144603405'];['Matt Skach', 'Manish Arora', 'Chang-Hong Hsu', 'Qi Li', 'D.

c802ceb7a9ff904220c48ee44ae9b671be6d6379;On the Convergence of FedAvg on Non-IID Data;"Federated learning enables a large amount of edge computing devices to jointly learn a model without data sharing. As a leading algorithm in this setting, Federated Averaging (\texttt{FedAvg}) runs Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in parallel on a small subset of the total devices and averages the sequences only once in a while. Despite its simplicity, it lacks theoretical guarantees under realistic settings. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of \texttt{FedAvg} on non-iid data and establish a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T})$ for strongly convex and smooth problems, where $T$ is the number of SGDs.

700701edfd2c03eb88aaaa15b306ea5c48ce13a6;Accelerating large-scale data exploration through data diffusion;"Data-intensive applications often require exploratory analysis of large datasets. If analysis is performed on distributed resources, data locality can be crucial to high throughput and performance. We propose a ""data diffusion"" approach that acquires compute and storage resources dynamically, replicates data in response to demand, and schedules computations close to data. As demand increases, more resources are acquired, thus allowing faster response to subsequent requests that refer to the same data; when demand drops, resources are released. This approach can provide the benefits of dedicated hardware without the associated high costs, depending on workload and resource characteristics. The approach is reminiscent of cooperative caching, web-caching, and peer-to-peer storage systems, but addresses different application demands. Other data-aware scheduling approaches assume dedicated resources, which can be expensive and/or inefficient if load varies significantly. To explore the feasibility of the data diffusion approach, we have extended the Falkon resource provisioning and task scheduling";['1747651', '2151269913', '1698701', '7934073'];['I.

Therefore, predicting heart disease through some simple physical indicators obtained from the regular physical examination at an early stage has become a valuable subject. Clinically, it is essential to be sensitive to these indicators related to heart disease to make predictions and provide a reliable basis for further diagnosis. However, the large amount of data makes manual analysis and prediction taxing and arduous. Our research aims to predict heart disease both accurately and quickly through various indicators of the body. In this paper, a novel heart disease prediction model is given. We propose a heart disease prediction algorithm that combines the embedded feature selection method and deep neural networks. This embedded feature selection method is based on the LinearSVC algorithm, using the L1 norm as a penalty item to choose a subset;['47845094', '2243184280', '2137389507', '2152111564', '2153359007', '2141510570', '2110204947', '27002702', '2144367613'];['Dengqing Zhang', 'Yunyi Chen', 'Yuxuan Chen', 'Shengyi Ye', 'Wenyu Cai', 'Junxue Jiang', 'Yechuan Xu', 'Gongfeng Zheng', 'Ming Chen'];;;;;;;t4sd0qhf;Journal of Healthcare Engineering;2021.0;2021;['Medicine'];['df99898ad6d997cd5b91bd2262e137a1d77fe152', 'a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8', 'ea9d2a2b4ce11aaf85136840c65f3bc9c03ab649']

In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach for achieving efficient computation offloading for mobile cloud computing. We formulate the decentralized computation offloading decision making problem among mobile device users as a decentralized computation offloading game. We analyze the structural property of the game and show that the game always admits a Nash equilibrium. We then design a decentralized computation offloading mechanism that can achieve a Nash equilibrium of the game and quantify its efficiency ratio over the centralized optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can achieve efficient computation offloading performance and scale well as the system size increases.;['2118183087'];['Xu Chen'];;;;;;;1hi1dzym;IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems;2014.0;26;['Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['3407e4b1993b44d14c71c1683994b3e58444eb67', '9cfe79734c25c80aa210847320298d3618445e20', '497591fed66f38f1cc00f160858d229d3e810ff2', '731304583d2e40bf6ee030e3cd81f767713f999a', '0f7dd6bcaf4c2a64b3a51b7351929dab23584ea8']

However, a central challenge in video prediction is that the future is highly uncertain: a sequence of past observations of events can imply many possible futures. Although a number of recent works have studied probabilistic models that can represent uncertain futures, such models are either extremely expensive computationally as in the case of pixel-level autoregressive models, or do not directly optimize the likelihood of the data. To our knowledge, our work is the first to propose multi-frame video prediction with normalizing flows, which allows for direct optimization of the data likelihood, and produces high-quality stochastic predictions. We describe an approach for modeling the latent space dynamics, and demonstrate that flow-based generative models offer a viable and competitive approach to generative modelling of video.;['2157851439', '3365707', '1761978', '46881670', '1736651', '46573521', '70429380'];['Manoj Kumar', 'M.

4af67db7cb510052f9219f23c3d4d309f222ef20;SoftRAN: software defined radio access network;An important piece of the cellular network infrastructure is the radio access network (RAN) that provides wide-area wireless connectivity to mobile devices. The fundamental problem the RAN solves is figuring out how best to use and manage limited spectrum to achieve this connectivity. In a dense wireless deployment with mobile nodes and limited spectrum, it becomes a difficult task to allocate radio resources, implement handovers, manage interference, balance load between cells, etc. We argue that LTE's current distributed control plane is suboptimal in achieving the above objective. We propose SoftRAN, a fundamental rethink of the radio access layer. SoftRAN is a software defined centralized control plane for radio access networks that abstracts all base stations in a local geographical area as a virtual big-base station comprised of a central controller and radio elements (individual physical base stations).

Crucially, the construction is applicable to unstructured point clouds and other noisy real-world data. We show that tangent convolutions can be evaluated efficiently on large-scale point clouds with millions of points. Using tangent convolutions, we design a deep fully-convolutional network for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds, and apply it to challenging real-world datasets of indoor and outdoor 3D environments.

However, most current approaches operate in the 2D image space. Direct semantic segmentation of unstructured 3D point clouds is still an open research problem. The recently proposed PointNet architecture presents an interesting step ahead in that it can operate on unstructured point clouds, achieving encouraging segmentation results. However, it subdivides the input points into a grid of blocks and processes each such block individually. In this paper, we investigate the question how such an architecture can be extended to incorporate larger-scale spatial context. We build upon PointNet and propose two extensions that enlarge the receptive field over the 3D scene.

a25d6f407eaa62897118f1fb0567db75cff3bab0;Workload characterization of interactive cloud services on big and small server platforms;Key-value stores (e.g., Memcached) and web servers (e.g., NGINX) are widely used by cloud providers. As interactive services, they have strict service-level objectives, with typical 99th-percentile tail latencies on the order of a few milliseconds. Unlike average latency, tail latency is more sensitive to changes in usage load and traffic patterns, system configurations, and resource availability. Understanding the sensitivity of tail latency to application and system factors is critical to efficiently design and manage systems for these latency-critical services. We present a comprehensive study of the impact a diverse set of application, hardware, and isolation configurations have on tail latency for two representative interactive services, Memcached and NGINX. Examined factors include input load, thread-level parallelism, request size, virtualization, and resource partitioning. We conduct this study on two server platforms with significant differences in terms of architecture and price points: an Intel Xeon and an ARM-based Cavium ThunderX server.

2a33d0939cb4f9200d401a453146bb120ee3b403;Recurrent Slice Networks for 3D Segmentation of Point Clouds;Point clouds are an efficient data format for 3D data. However, existing 3D segmentation methods for point clouds either do not model local dependencies [21] or require added computations [14, 23]. This work presents a novel 3D segmentation framework, RSNet1, to efficiently model local structures in point clouds. The key component of the RSNet is a lightweight local dependency module. It is a combination of a novel slice pooling layer, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layers, and a slice unpooling layer. The slice pooling layer is designed to project features of unordered points onto an ordered sequence of feature vectors so that traditional end-to-end learning algorithms (RNNs) can be applied. The performance of RSNet is validated by comprehensive experiments on the S3DIS[1], ScanNet[3], and ShapeNet [34] datasets. In its simplest form, RSNets surpass all previous state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks. And comparisons against previous state-of-the-art methods [21, 23] demonstrate the efficiency;['2004337', '2108446987', '143840663'];['Qiangui Huang', 'Weiyue Wang', 'U.

We propose a novel spatial convolution utilizing a random walk to uncover the relations within the input, analogous to the way the standard convolution uses the spatial neighborhood of a pixel on the grid. The convolution has an intuitive interpretation, is efficient and scalable and can also be used on data with varying graph structure. Furthermore, this generalization can be applied to many standard regression or classification problems, by learning the the underlying graph. We empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed CNN on MNIST, and challenge the state-of-the-art on Merck molecular activity data set.;['5395574', '2652246', '47901118'];['Yotam Hechtlinger', 'Purvasha Chakravarti', 'Jining Qin'];;;;;;;gyz5mxay;ArXiv;2017.0;abs/1704.08165;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Neural Networks'];['0e779fd59353a7f1f5b559b9d65fa4bfe367890c', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '492f57ee9ceb61fb5a47ad7aebfec1121887a175', '18b47b83a373f33d6b902a3615f42c10f7600d72', '5d1bfeed240709725c78bc72ea40e55410b373dc', 'a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8', '3efd851140aa28e95221b55fcc5659eea97b172d']
b4d6e3237b39ea379090b2feaef90d396ca7b9d7;A Standards-Based Architecture Proposal for Integrating Patient mHealth Apps to Electronic Health Record Systems;Summary Summary Background: Mobile health Applications (mHealth Apps) are opening the way to patients’ responsible and active involvement with their own healthcare management. However, apart from Apps allowing patient’s access to their electronic health records (EHRs), mHealth Apps are currently developed as dedicated “island systems”. Objective: Although much work has been done on patient’s access to EHRs, transfer of information from mHealth Apps to EHR systems is still low. This study proposes a standards-based architecture that can be adopted by mHealth Apps to exchange information with EHRs to support better quality of care. Methods: Following the definition of requirements for the EHR/mHealth App information exchange recently proposed, and after reviewing current standards, we designed the architecture for EHR/mHealth App integration. Then, as a case study, we modeled a system based on the proposed architecture aimed to support home monitoring for congestive heart failure patients. We simulated such process using, on;['2230159404', '3109194', '2056294228', '153705968'];['Sara Renata Francesca Marceglia', 'P. Fontelo', 'E. Rossi', 'M.

To reduce the energy consumption and simultaneously guarantee the service performance of the dense heterogeneous networks, this paper proposes an energy-saving algorithm with joint user association, clustering, and ON/OFF strategies. First, for the user association subproblem, an optimal association policy, which is related to load balancing and energy efficiency, is designed for the new arriving user equipment (UE) and re-associated UE. Second, based on the locations and load of the base stations (BSs), the clustering subproblem is modeled as an integer linear programming, and the near-optimal clustering results are obtained by using the semi-definite programming. Finally, an intra-cluster ON/OFF strategy for the switching ON/OFF subproblem is designed in which the chosen BSs to be switched OFF are decided by their load effect to;['2618744', '2108488352', '2155651721', '8559810'];['Lun Tang', 'Weili Wang', 'Yang Wang', 'Qianbin Chen'];;;;;;;or3bmyqe;IEEE Access;2017.0;5;['Clustering', 'Computer Science'];[]

Nevertheless, it has the side effect of introducing more complex interference scenarios, needing to be properly managed by means of coordination mechanisms. The recently introduced Cloud-RAN architecture, based on centralized processing, enables the implementation of efficient interference prevention and cancelation algorithms across multiple cells. However, it struggles with the need of high-capacity front-haul links and cost-intensive deployments. This paper introduces the novel concept of RANaaS (Radio Access Network-as-a-Service) as a flexible architecture based on centralized processing, capable of handling the increasing interference in very dense networks, reducing energy consumption, cost-efficiently deploying and managing cellular networks.;['3195299', '145566453', '2895072', '2864770', '2568856', '1398858978', '2822733', '2374288'];['D.

In this paper, we introduce a new spectral domain convolutional architecture for deep learning on graphs. The core ingredient of our model is a new class of parametric rational complex functions (Cayley polynomials) allowing to efficiently compute spectral filters on graphs that specialize on frequency bands of interest. Our model generates rich spectral filters that are localized in space, scales linearly with the size of the input data for sparsely connected graphs, and can handle different constructions of Laplacian operators.

abce35b357dff68131fa038f291c99a82729bd9a;An Observational Study of Cloud-Topped Mixed Layers;Abstract The turbulence and mean structure of oceanic stratocumulus was studied using aircraft data collected during the summer of 1976 off the coast of California. Three cloud-topped mixed layers were studied in detail. They consisted of 1) a thin cloud capped by an inversion at a height of ∼1000 m, 2) a relatively thick but broken cloud layer capped by a weak inversion at ∼600 m and 3) a solid cloud capped by a strong inversion at ∼600 m. The mean temperature, moisture, liquid water and radiative characteristics obtained for these three cases were compared. Heat and moisture fluxes were also calculated and compared. Although there was considerable variation in the characteristics of the three cloud-topped mixed layers studied, all indicated the validity of the general approach used in simple mixed-layer models of stratocumulus. But for these models to be useful, they should be generalized to allow clouds other than;['98507616', '102561541', '144976182'];['B. Albrecht', 'R. Penc', 'W.

30d148d21c20c1682bfbea5ffa41d83c8abdc64c;Representation Learning and Adversarial Generation of 3D Point Clouds;Three-dimensional geometric data offer an excellent domain for studying representation learning and generative modeling. In this paper, we look at geometric data represented as point clouds. We introduce a deep autoencoder network for point clouds, which outperforms the state of the art in 3D recognition tasks. We also design GAN architectures to generate novel point-clouds. Importantly, we show that by training the GAN in the latent space learned by the autoencoder, we greatly boost the GAN's data-generating capacity, creating significantly more diverse and realistic geometries, with far simpler architectures. The expressive power of our learned embedding, obtained without human supervision, enables basic shape editing applications via simple algebraic manipulations, such as semantic part editing and shape interpolation.;['22199114', '1868022', '3168518', '51352814'];['Panos Achlioptas', 'Olga Diamanti', 'Ioannis Mitliagkas', 'L.

Microservices face single-digit millisecond RPC latency goals (implying sub-ms medians)—much tighter than their monolithic ancestors that must meet $\ge 100$ ms latency targets. Sub-ms-scale OS/network overheads that were once insignificant for such monoliths can now come to dominate in the sub-ms-scale microservice regime. It is therefore vital to characterize the influence of OS- and network-based effects on microservices. Unfortunately, widely-used academic data center benchmark suites are unsuitable to aid this characterization as they (1) use monolithic rather than microservice architectures, and (2) largely have request service times $\ge 100$ ms. In this paper, we investigate how OS and network overheads impact microservice median and tail latency by developing a complete suite of microservices called $ \mu$ Suite that we use to facilitate our study. $ \mu$ Suite;['38818738', '3334450'];['Akshitha Sriraman', 'T.

fe33ba23625e0039b6bddf69a63f43dfe22928b1;BCube: a high performance, server-centric network architecture for modular data centers;This paper presents BCube, a new network architecture specifically designed for shipping-container based, modular data centers. At the core of the BCube architecture is its server-centric network structure, where servers with multiple network ports connect to multiple layers of COTS (commodity off-the-shelf) mini-switches. Servers act as not only end hosts, but also relay nodes for each other. BCube supports various bandwidth-intensive applications by speeding-up one-to-one, one-to-several, and one-to-all traffic patterns, and by providing high network capacity for all-to-all traffic. BCube exhibits graceful performance degradation as the server and/or switch failure rate increases. This property is of special importance for shipping-container data centers, since once the container is sealed and operational, it becomes very difficult to repair or replace its components. Our implementation experiences show that BCube can be seamlessly integrated with the TCP/IP protocol stack and BCube packet forwarding can be efficiently implemented in both hardware and software.

170e2f4778f975768aaa5e888349fc0cb23d576f;Point Cloud GAN;Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) can achieve promising performance on learning complex data distributions on different types of data. In this paper, we first show a straightforward extension of existing GAN algorithm is not applicable to point clouds, because the constraint required for discriminators is undefined for set data. We propose a two fold modification to GAN algorithm for learning to generate point clouds (PC-GAN). First, we combine ideas from hierarchical Bayesian modeling and implicit generative models by learning a hierarchical and interpretable sampling process. A key component of our method is that we train a posterior inference network for the hidden variables. Second, instead of using only state-of-the-art Wasserstein GAN objective, we propose a sandwiching objective, which results in a tighter Wasserstein distance estimate than the commonly used dual form. Thereby, PC-GAN defines a generic framework that can incorporate many existing GAN algorithms.

Optical properties of the anvils are inferred from satellite observations and from high-altitude aircraft measurements. An infrared multiple-scattering model is used to compute heating rates in tropical anvils. Layer-average heating rates in 2 km thick anvils were found to be on the order of 20 to 30°K day−1. The difference between heating rates at cloud bottom and cloud top ranges from 30 to 200°K day−1, leading to convective instability in the anvil. The calculations are most sensitive to the assumed ice water content, but also are affected by the vertical distribution of ice water content and by the anvil thickness. Solar heating in anvils is shown to be less important than infrared hearing but not negligible The dynamical implications of the computed heating rates are also explored and we conclude that the heating may have important;['2142438', '2214753', '144378756', '47384717'];['T.

We tackle the object recognition problem using two data representations, to achieve leading results on the Princeton ModelNet challenge. The two representations: 1. Volumetric representation: the 3D object is discretized spatially as binary voxels - $1$ if the voxel is occupied and $0$ otherwise. 2. Pixel representation: the 3D object is represented as a set of projected 2D pixel images. Current leading submissions to the ModelNet Challenge use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on pixel representations. However, we diverge from this trend and additionally, use Volumetric CNNs to bridge the gap between the efficiency of the above two representations. We combine both representations and exploit them to learn new features, which yield a significantly better classifier than using either of the representations in isolation. To do this, we introduce new Volumetric CNN (V-CNN) architectures.;['29876151', '5985064'];['Vishakh Hegde', 'R.

Different from traditional sensor networks, sensor nodes in CRSNs are embedded cognitive radio modules, enabling them to dynamically access the licensed channels. Since the dynamic channel access is critical to guarantee the network capacity for CRSNs, existing solutions without considering the dynamic channel access cannot be directly applied into CRSNs. To this end, we aim at maximizing the network utility by jointly controlling the sampling rates and channel access of sensor nodes, under the energy consumption, channel capacity and interference constraints. With the consideration of fluctuated energy harvesting rates and channel switching costs, we formulate the network utility maximization as a mix-integer non-linear programming problem and solve it in an efficient and decoupled way by means of dual decomposition.

These computations, which were obtained using the doubling method, are compared with comparable results obtained using selected radiative transfer approximations. Both the relative and absolute accuracies of asymptotic theory for thick layers and delta-Eddington, Meador–Weaver and Coakley–Chýlek approximations are compared as a function of optical thickness, solar zenith angle and single scattering albedo. Asymptotic theory is found to be accurate to within 5% for all optical thickness greater than about 6. On the other hand, the Coakley–Chýlek approximation is accurate to within 5% for thin atmospheres having optical thickness less than about 0.2 for most values of the solar zenith angle.

They are especially powerful once annotated with semantic information such as salient regions and functional parts. We propose a novel active learning method capable of enriching massive geometric datasets with accurate semantic region annotations. Given a shape collection and a user-specified region label our goal is to correctly demarcate the corresponding regions with minimal manual work. Our active framework achieves this goal by cycling between manually annotating the regions, automatically propagating these annotations across the rest of the shapes, manually verifying both human and automatic annotations, and learning from the verification results to improve the automatic propagation algorithm. We use a unified utility function that explicitly models the time cost of human input across all steps of our method.

Recently, deep learning networks with a triplet loss become a common framework for person ReID. However, the triplet loss pays main attentions on obtaining correct orders on the training set. It still suffers from a weaker generalization capability from the training set to the testing set, thus resulting in inferior performance. In this paper, we design a quadruplet loss, which can lead to the model output with a larger inter-class variation and a smaller intra-class variation compared to the triplet loss. As a result, our model has a better generalization ability and can achieve a higher performance on the testing set. In particular, a quadruplet deep network using a margin-based online hard negative mining is proposed based on the quadruplet loss for the person ReID.

One main challenge is solving the joint problems of interference mitigation, user association, and resource allocation. These problems are formulated as an optimization which is then analyzed using two different approaches: Markov approximation and log-linear learning. However, finding the optimal solutions of both approaches requires complete information of the whole network which is not scalable with the network size. Thus, an approach based on a Markov approximation with a novel Markov chain design and transition probabilities is proposed. This approach enables the Markov chain to converge to the bounded near optimal distribution without complete information. In the game-theoretic approach, the payoff-based log-linear learning is used, and it converges in probability to a mixed-strategy $\epsilon$ -Nash equilibrium.

a022efe4016f804f007afd3a1976bed3b1136df3;Optimal Joint Scheduling and Cloud Offloading for Mobile Applications;Cloud offloading is an indispensable solution to supporting computationally demanding applications on resource constrained mobile devices. In this paper, we introduce the concept of wireless aware joint scheduling and computation offloading (JSCO) for multi-component applications, where an optimal decision is made on which components need to be offloaded as well as the scheduling order of these components. The JSCO approach allows for more degrees of freedom in the solution by moving away from a compiler pre-determined scheduling order for the components towards a more wireless aware scheduling order. For some component dependency graph structures, the proposed algorithm can shorten execution times by parallel processing appropriate components in the mobile and cloud. We define a net utility that trades-off the energy saved by the mobile, subject to constraints on the communication delay, overall application execution time, and component precedence ordering. The linear optimization problem is solved using real data measurements obtained;['144175760', '144096306', '49435796'];['S. E. Mahmoodi', 'R. Uma', 'K. P.

To realize the concept, the core problem is how a PSN node can securely share health data with other nodes in the network. In this paper, we propose a secure system for PSN-based healthcare. Two protocols are designed for the system. The first one is an improved version of the IEEE 802.15.6 display authenticated association. It establishes secure links with unbalanced computational requirements for mobile devices and resource-limited sensor nodes. The second protocol uses blockchain technique to share health data among PSN nodes. We realize a protocol suite to study protocol runtime and other factors. In addition, human body channels are proposed for PSN nodes in some use cases. The proposed system illustrates a potential method of using blockchain for PSN-based applications.;['50561631', '8797930', '46423072'];['Jie Zhang', 'Nian Xue', 'Xin Huang'];;;;;;;kdoltuvr;IEEE Access;2016.0;4;['Computer Science'];[]
cc8d1aa1308d145bdb2652e2c6a6d39418525dbe;Quality-Aware Traffic Offloading in Wireless Networks;In cellular networks, due to many practical deployment issues, some areas have good wireless coverage while other areas may not. This results in significant throughput (service quality) difference between wireless carriers at some locations. We first analyze the factors that affect the service quality and then validate the existence of service quality difference between different carriers via extensive measurements. To deal with this problem, a mobile device (node) with low service quality can offload its data traffic to nearby nodes with better service quality through Device-to-Device interfaces, such as WiFi direct, to save energy and reduce delay. To achieve this goal, we propose a Quality-Aware Traffic Offloading (QATO) framework to offload network tasks to neighboring nodes with better service quality. QATO can identify neighbors with better service quality and motivate nodes to help each other using incentive schemes. To validate our design, we have implemented QATO on Android platform and;['50105347', '1740564'];['Wenjie Hu', 'G.

Although the basic control flow of this framework has existed in parallel SQL database management systems (DBMS) for over 20 years, some have called MR a dramatically new computing model [8, 17]. In this paper, we describe and compare both paradigms. Furthermore, we evaluate both kinds of systems in terms of performance and development complexity. To this end, we define a benchmark consisting of a collection of tasks that we have run on an open source version of MR as well as on two parallel DBMSs. For each task, we measure each system's performance for various degrees of parallelism on a cluster of 100 nodes. Our results reveal some interesting trade-offs.

f1489d11c418afddf135ac75a0c037a368c9edc3;Energy-Efficient Decision Making for Mobile Cloud Offloading;Mobile cloud offloading migrates heavy computation from mobile devices to remote cloud resources or nearby cloudlets. It is a promising method to alleviate the struggle between resource-constrained mobile devices and resource-hungry mobile applications. Caused by frequently changing location mobile users often see dynamically changing network conditions which have a great impact on the perceived application performance. Therefore, making high-quality offloading decisions at run time is difficult in mobile environments. To balance the energy-delay tradeoff based on different offloading-decision criteria (e.g., minimum response time or energy consumption), an energy-efficient offloading-decision algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization is proposed. The algorithm determines when to run the application locally, when to forward it directly for remote execution to a cloud infrastructure and when to delegate it via a nearby cloudlet to the cloud. The algorithm is able to minimize the average energy consumption on the mobile device while ensuring that the average response time;['1716948', '2116960773', '145037692'];['Huaming Wu', 'Yi Sun', 'K.

The state-of-the-art methods now achieve over 90% correct category level recognition performance on appearance images.

The key idea is to pool information from views which are similar and thus belong to the same cluster. The pooled feature vectors are then fed as inputs to the same layer, in a recurrent fashion. This recurrent clustering and pooling module, when inserted in an off-the-shelf pretrained CNN, boosts performance for multi-view 3D object recognition, achieving a new state of the art test set recognition accuracy of 93.8% on the ModelNet 40 database.

To minimize the size of the forwarding tables, SoftCell aggregates traffic along multiple dimensions---the service policy, the base station, and the mobile device---at different switches in the network. Since most traffic originates from mobile devices, SoftCell performs fine-grained packet classification at the access switches, next to the base stations, where software switches can easily handle the state and bandwidth requirements.

15ca7adccf5cd4dc309cdcaa6328f4c429ead337;FPNN: Field Probing Neural Networks for 3D Data;Building discriminative representations for 3D data has been an important task in computer graphics and computer vision research. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown to operate on 2D images with great success for a variety of tasks. Lifting convolution operators to 3D (3DCNNs) seems like a plausible and promising next step. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of 3D CNNs grows cubically with respect to voxel resolution. Moreover, since most 3D geometry representations are boundary based, occupied regions do not increase proportionately with the size of the discretization, resulting in wasted computation.

a84906dbd4d6640f918d0b6ed2a7313dda0d55f1;Panoptic Feature Pyramid Networks;The recently introduced panoptic segmentation task has renewed our community's interest in unifying the tasks of instance segmentation (for thing classes) and semantic segmentation (for stuff classes). However, current state-of-the-art methods for this joint task use separate and dissimilar networks for instance and semantic segmentation, without performing any shared computation. In this work, we aim to unify these methods at the architectural level, designing a single network for both tasks. Our approach is to endow Mask R-CNN, a popular instance segmentation method, with a semantic segmentation branch using a shared Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone. Surprisingly, this simple baseline not only remains effective for instance segmentation, but also yields a lightweight, top-performing method for semantic segmentation. In this work, we perform a detailed study of this minimally extended version of Mask R-CNN with FPN, which we refer to as Panoptic FPN, and show it is a robust and accurate baseline;['144843400', '2983898', '39353098', '3127283'];['Alexander Kirillov', 'Ross B.

6a2ff3baa579618dcadc2b4099738b287b22b9b8;The Effect of Cloud Sides on Reflected Solar Radiation as Deduced from Satellite Observations;Abstract We report the observation of a feature that is characteristic of the reflection of solar radiation from absorbing, finite clouds. When absorption takes place, more radiation can be reflected by broken cloud fields than by extensive unbroken cloud fields. We observe this feature in solar radiation at 3.7 μm reflected by low-level, single-layered systems of water clouds over the Pacific Ocean. Interpreting the effect as due to geometrical factors, we note that absorption causes the reflected radiances to be highly anisotropic, so that they are generally greater from the sun-facing cloud sides than from the cloud tops. Diffusive leakage of radiation through the cloud sides is also reduced, and as a result maximum reflectivities occur in situations that maximize the contributions to the reflected radiation from the sides relative to that from the tops. Interpreting the effect as due to changes in liquid water content and cloud droplet sizes,;['92042336', '2178267291'];['J. Coakley', 'R.

f0daa4b6f33751ff85fb36cd0583c6769a53e0ec;PMP-Net: Point Cloud Completion by Learning Multi-step Point Moving Paths;The task of point cloud completion aims to predict the missing part for an incomplete 3D shape. A widely used strategy is to generate a complete point cloud from the incomplete one. However, the unordered nature of point clouds will degrade the generation of high-quality 3D shapes, as the detailed topology and structure of discrete points are hard to be captured by the generative process only using a latent code. In this paper, we address the above problem by reconsidering the completion task from a new perspective, where we formulate the prediction as a point cloud deformation process. Specifically, we design a novel neural network, named PMP-Net, to mimic the behavior of an earth mover. It moves move each point of the incomplete input to complete the point cloud, where the total distance of point moving paths (PMP) should be shortest.

Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a new computing paradigm with a great potential to enhance vehicular performance by offloading applications from the resource-constrained vehicles to lightweight and ubiquitous VEC servers. Nevertheless, offloading schemes, where all vehicles offload their tasks to the same VEC server, can limit the performance gain due to overload. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose integrating load balancing with offloading, and study resource allocation for a multiuser multiserver VEC system. First, we formulate the joint load balancing and offloading problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem to maximize system utility. Particularly, we take IEEE 802.11p protocol into consideration for modeling the system utility. Then, we decouple the problem as two subproblems;['35538856', '2145170', '2461792', '2152819646'];['Yueyue Dai', 'Du Xu', 'Sabita Maharjan', 'Yan Zhang'];;;;;;;xc7o1w71;IEEE Internet of Things Journal;2019.0;6;['Computer Science'];['a2f808a24d996f9e9d0bfc054128c69b73d96767', '0d88252e3a8777618d680fbb7fe64f8c1bdd1483']

Revenue Management as a relatively new economic paradigm provides various tools to optimally allocate capacity and increase revenue. We provide a framework how the matured concepts of Revenue Management can be deployed to Grid Computing. We analyze whether the Grid Computing domain has notable differences from the airline industry or other common areas for Revenue Management like restaurant, hotel or car rental industries.

The key contribution of our method is its ability to handle large scenes with varying spatial extent, managing the cubic growth in data size as scene size increases. To this end, we devise a fully-convolutional generative 3D CNN model whose filter kernels are invariant to the overall scene size. The model can be trained on scene subvolumes but deployed on arbitrarily large scenes at test time. In addition, we propose a coarse-to-fine inference strategy in order to produce high-resolution output while also leveraging large input context sizes.

NaDa uses ISP-controlled home gateways to provide computing and storage services and adopts a managed peer-to-peer model to form a distributed data center infrastructure. To evaluate the potential for energy savings in NaDa platform we pick Video-on-Demand (VoD) services. We develop an energy consumption model for VoD in traditional and in NaDa data centers and evaluate this model using a large set of empirical VoD access data. We find that even under the most pessimistic scenarios, NaDa saves at least 20% to 30% of the energy compared to traditional data centers. These savings stem from energy-preserving properties inherent to NaDa such as the reuse of already committed baseline power on underutilized gateways, the avoidance of cooling costs, and the reduction of network energy consumption as a result;['2591679', '1683137', '1768703', '1737360', '144594997'];['Vytautas Valancius', 'Nikolaos Laoutaris', 'L.

Toward this future goal, this work aims to extend Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized learning framework that enables privacy-preserving training of models, to work with heterogeneous clients in a practical cellular network.

Also, LSM-trees cannot become fragmented and provide fast, predictable index scans. Rose's write performance relies on replicas' ability to perform writes without looking up old values. LSM-tree lookups have performance comparable to B-tree lookups. If Rose read each value that it updated then its write throughput would also be comparable to a B-tree.

The study is focused on one aspect of the experiment, the predicted response of the ocean to the warming episode. A fourfold increase in atmospheric CO2 causes a warming sufficiently intense to produce a partial collapse of the thermohaline circulation of the ocean. Surprisingly, the wind-driven circulation of the ocean is maintained without appreciable change. The global hydrological cycle intensifies without a major shift of the pattern of net precipitation over the model ocean. In the warming episode the downward pathways for heat, which include diffusion and Ekman pumping, remain open. The partial collapse of the thermohaline circulation closes the normal upward pathways associated with abyssal upwelling and high-latitude convection. As a result the thermocline is able to sequester almost twice as much heat than would be predicted from;['46975322', '4412053'];['K. Bryan', 'M.

However, given their high memory and computational demands, running them on mobile devices has required expert optimization or custom hardware. We present a framework that, given an arbitrary DNN, compiles it down to a resource-efficient variant at modest loss in accuracy. Further, we introduce novel techniques to specialize DNNs to contexts and to share resources across multiple simultaneously executing DNNs. Using the challenging continuous mobile vision domain as a case study, we show that our techniques yield very significant reductions in DNN resource usage and perform effectively over a broad range of operating conditions.;['3050154', '3041721', '145956785', '1793636'];['Haichen Shen', 'Matthai Philipose', 'S.

Offloading decisions for mobile cloud collaboration involve many decision factors. One of important decision factors is the network unavailability that has not been well studied. This paper presents an offloading decision model that takes network unavailability into consideration. Network with some unavailability can be modeled as an alternating renewal process. Then, application execution time and energy consumption in both ideal network and network with some unavailability are analyzed. Based on the presented theoretical model, an application partition algorithm and a decision module are presented to produce an offloading decision that is resistant to network unavailability. Simulation results demonstrate good performance of proposed scheme, where the proposed partition algorithm is analyzed in different application and cloud scenarios.;['150128828', '34577327', '2188694'];['Huijun Wu', 'Dijiang Huang', 'S.

The latency profile of these multi-stage applications is intrinsically variable, making it challenging to provide satisfactory responsiveness. Given a limited power budget, improving the end-to-end latency requires intelligently boosting the bottleneck service across stages using multiple boosting techniques. However, prior work fail to acknowledge the multi-stage nature of user-facing applications and perform poorly in improving responsiveness on power constrained CMP, as they are unable to accurately identify bottleneck service and apply the boosting techniques adaptively. In this paper, we present PowerChief, a runtime framework that 1) provides joint design of service and query to monitor the latency statistics across service stages and accurately identifies the bottleneck service during runtime; 2) adaptively chooses the boosting technique to accelerate the bottleneck service with improved responsiveness; 3) dynamically reallocates the constrained power budget across service";['46402263', '1596812259', '38716473', '1698860', '2235128', '144603405'];['Hailong Yang', 'Quan Chen', 'Moeiz Riaz', 'Zhongzhi Luan', 'Lingjia Tang', 'Jason Mars'];deedf64a-dd5c-4b33-b345-ff83bfb93d71;International Symposium on Computer Architecture;conference;12;2017.0;New York;;;;;['Computer Science'];['43df18622279d0107d5cf020f917d61b56bfeacc', 'bc1022b031dc6c7019696492e8116598097a8c12', 'ad61a05a10319f4a95733b833fc4be1115670d95']

A recent method employs 3D voxels to represent 3D shapes, but this limits the approach to low resolutions due to the computational cost caused by the cubic complexity of 3D voxels. Hence the method suffers from a lack of detailed geometry. To resolve this issue, we propose Y2Seq2Seq, a view-based model, to learn cross-modal representations by joint reconstruction and prediction of view and word sequences. Specifically, the network architecture of Y2Seq2Seq bridges the semantic meaning embedded in the two modalities by two coupled “Y” like sequence-tosequence (Seq2Seq) structures. In addition, our novel hierarchical constraints further increase the discriminability of the cross-modal representations by employing more detailed discriminative information. Experimental results on cross-modal retrieval and 3D shape captioning show that Y2Seq2Seq outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.;['2904100', '2057174474', '2107935023', '46399275', '1796846'];['Zhizhong Han', 'Mingyang Shang', 'Xiyang Wang', 'Yu-Shen Liu', 'Matthias Zwicker'];bdc2e585-4e48-4e36-8af1-6d859763d405;AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence;conference;20;2018.0;Barcelona;;;;;['Computer Science'];[]

Existing tools and methodologies for measuring these effects suffer from a number of deficiencies including poor load tester design, statistically inaccurate aggregation, and improper attribution of effects. As shown in the paper, these pitfalls can often result in misleading conclusions. In this paper, we develop a methodology for statistically rigorous performance evaluation and performance factor attribution for server workloads. First, we find that careful design of the server load tester can ensure high;['3216153', '143911048', '144603405', '2235128'];['Yunqi Zhang', 'David Meisner', 'Jason Mars', 'Lingjia Tang'];deedf64a-dd5c-4b33-b345-ff83bfb93d71;International Symposium on Computer Architecture;conference;20;2016.0;Chicago;;;;;['Computer Science'];['0c6c30e3052fcc01aa5ee38252d77f75322d7b3f', '43df18622279d0107d5cf020f917d61b56bfeacc', 'c69859fd9ee74e5287c5dbf22ee7e82663fe8bdd']

In order to develop a detector that successfully operates under these conditions, it becomes critical to leverage upon multiple cues, multiple imaging modalities, and a strong multiview (MV) classifier that accounts for different object views and poses. In this paper, we provide an extensive evaluation that gives insight into how each of these aspects (multicue, multimodality, and strong MV classifier) affect accuracy both individually and when integrated together. In the multimodality component, we explore the fusion of RGB and depth maps obtained by high-definition light detection and ranging, a type of modality that is starting to receive increasing attention. As our analysis reveals, although all the aforementioned aspects significantly help in improving the accuracy, the fusion of visible spectrum and depth information allows to boost the accuracy by a much larger margin.

510d98681e5e85fb1265513728f16e2543ae1b4b;Hypergraph Neural Networks;In this paper, we present a hypergraph neural networks (HGNN) framework for data representation learning, which can encode high-order data correlation in a hypergraph structure. Confronting the challenges of learning representation for complex data in real practice, we propose to incorporate such data structure in a hypergraph, which is more flexible on data modeling, especially when dealing with complex data. In this method, a hyperedge convolution operation is designed to handle the data correlation during representation learning. In this way, traditional hypergraph learning procedure can be conducted using hyperedge convolution operations efficiently. HGNN is able to learn the hidden layer representation considering the high-order data structure, which is a general framework considering the complex data correlations. We have conducted experiments on citation network classification and visual object recognition tasks and compared HGNN with graph convolutional networks and other traditional methods.

Falkon integrates (1) multi-level scheduling to separate resource acquisition (via, e.g., requests to batch schedulers) from task dispatch, and (2) a streamlined dispatcher. Falkon's integration of multi-level scheduling and streamlined dispatchers delivers performance not provided by any other system. We describe Falkon architecture and implementation, and present performance results for both microbenchmarks and applications. Microbenchmarks show that Falkon throughput (487 tasks/sec) and scalability (to 54,000 executors and 2,000,000 tasks processed in just 112 minutes) are one to two orders of magnitude better than other systems used in production Grids. Large-scale astronomy and medical applications executed under Falkon by the Swift parallel programming system achieve up to 90% reduction in end-to-end run time, relative to versions that execute tasks via separate scheduler submissions.;['1747651', '2151269913', '144074950', '1698701', '144331405'];['I.

e2751a898867ce6687e08a5cc7bdb562e999b841;FCOS: Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection;We propose a fully convolutional one-stage object detector (FCOS) to solve object detection in a per-pixel prediction fashion, analogue to semantic segmentation. Almost all state-of-the-art object detectors such as RetinaNet, SSD, YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN rely on pre-defined anchor boxes. In contrast, our proposed detector FCOS is anchor box free, as well as proposal free. By eliminating the pre-defined set of anchor boxes, FCOS completely avoids the complicated computation related to anchor boxes such as calculating overlapping during training. More importantly, we also avoid all hyper-parameters related to anchor boxes, which are often very sensitive to the final detection performance. With the only post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS), FCOS with ResNeXt-64x4d-101 achieves 44.7% in AP with single-model and single-scale testing, surpassing previous one-stage detectors with the advantage of being much simpler.

However, particularly in datacenter environments, deployed applications face numerous dynamic environments over their lifetimes. As a result, this class of optimizations can result in sub-optimal performance due to the inability to flexibly adapt iteration spaces as cache conditions change at runtime. This paper introduces continuous shape shifiting, a compilation approach that removes the risks of cache tiling optimizations by dynamically rewriting (and reshaping) deployed, running application code. To realize continuous shape shifting, we present ShapeShifter, a framework for continuous monitoring of co-running applications and their runtime environments to reshape loop iteration spaces and pinpoint near-optimal loop tile configurations.

Pooling is widely used to aggregate views in deep learning models. However, pooling disregards a lot of content information within views and the spatial relationship among the views, which limits the discriminability of learned features. To resolve this issue, 3D to Sequential Views (3D2SeqViews) is proposed to more effectively aggregate the sequential views using convolutional neural networks with a novel hierarchical attention aggregation. Specifically, the content information within each view is first encoded. Then, the encoded view content information and the sequential spatiality among the views are simultaneously aggregated by the hierarchical attention aggregation, where view-level attention and class-level attention are proposed to hierarchically weight sequential views and shape classes. View-level attention is learned to indicate how much attention is paid to each view by each shape class, which subsequently weights sequential views through a novel recursive view integration.

However, learning representations for point clouds is particularly challenging due to their nature as being an unordered collection of points irregularly distributed in 3D space. Graph convolution, a generalization of the convolution operation for data defined over graphs, has been recently shown to be very successful at extracting localized features from point clouds in supervised or semi-supervised tasks such as classification or segmentation. This paper studies the unsupervised problem of a generative model exploiting graph convolution. We focus on the generator of a GAN and define methods for graph convolution when the graph is not known in advance as it is the very output of the generator.

The key to the success of CNNs is the convolution operator that is capable of leveraging spatially-local correlation in data represented densely in grids (e.g. images). However, point cloud are irregular and unordered, thus a direct convolving of kernels against the features associated with the points will result in deserting the shape information while being variant to the orders. To address these problems, we propose to learn a X-transformation from the input points, which is used for simultaneously weighting the input features associated with the points and permuting them into latent potentially canonical order. Then element-wise product and sum operations of typical convolution operator are applied on the X-transformed features. The proposed method is a generalization of typical CNNs into learning features from point cloud, thus we call it PointCNN.

Accordingly, the neighboring cells abstain from assigning high transmit powers to the specified RBs.

5eb4a5ac7faa2fc75e1739b45c511ba3fab5bb56;Mining Point Cloud Local Structures by Kernel Correlation and Graph Pooling;Unlike on images, semantic learning on 3D point clouds using a deep network is challenging due to the naturally unordered data structure. Among existing works, PointNet has achieved promising results by directly learning on point sets. However, it does not take full advantage of a point's local neighborhood that contains fine-grained structural information which turns out to be helpful towards better semantic learning. In this regard, we present two new operations to improve PointNet with a more efficient exploitation of local structures. The first one focuses on local 3D geometric structures. In analogy to a convolution kernel for images, we define a point-set kernel as a set of learnable 3D points that jointly respond to a set of neighboring data points according to their geometric affinities measured by kernel correlation, adapted from a similar technique for point cloud registration. The second one exploits local high-dimensional feature structures by recursive feature;['2577784', '144066717', '49576470', '144309297'];['Yiru Shen', 'Chen Feng', 'Yaoqing Yang', 'Dong Tian'];;;;;;;9og28cgy;2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition;2017.0;33;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Cloud'];['572a5aa00f0569887469ffb7554699c21156ba0b', '8674494bd7a076286b905912d26d47f7501c4046', 'b5007972c6f5a2294f83357c73e12664dd7c85b3', '1a39bb2caa151d15efd6718f3a80d9f4bff95af2', 'f48d322244c906b45792b28206df7cfb23495004', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba', 'f09f7888aa5aeaf88a2a44aea768d9a8747e97d2', '0e779fd59353a7f1f5b559b9d65fa4bfe367890c', '511ff60d4aa5ab2660552f02ee85692425912b46', '729d5c7dc6bfb32e47b5bd24cdb01ccaaf62bba5', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '87c757138d273ccd38216ca5266406a503507077', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '15ca7adccf5cd4dc309cdcaa6328f4c429ead337', '7c6de5a9e02a779e24504619050c6118f4eac181', '4cdcf2ae5e1fafebd9b3613247a7b1962584da34', '18b47b83a373f33d6b902a3615f42c10f7600d72', '5d1bfeed240709725c78bc72ea40e55410b373dc']
359ae7f918e7ab865cc10847dcbfa9ce8bf95365;Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation Optimization in Heterogeneous Networks With Mobile Edge Computing;In this paper, we propose a distributed joint computation offloading and resource allocation optimization (JCORAO) scheme in heterogeneous networks with mobile edge computing. An optimization problem is formulated to provide the optimal computation offloading strategy policy, uplink subchannel allocation, uplink transmission power allocation, and computation resource scheduling. The optimization problem is decomposed into two sub-problems due to the NP-hard property. In order to analyze the offloading strategy, a sub-algorithm named distributed potential game is built. The existence of Nash equilibrium is proved. To jointly allocate uplink subchannel, uplink transmission power, and computation resource for the offloading mobile terminals, a sub-algorithm named cloud and wireless resource allocation algorithm is designed. The solutions for subchannel allocation consist of uniform zero frequency reuse method without interference and fractional frequency reuse method based on Hungarian and graph coloring with interference.

In order to allow cities to share data across systems and coordinate processes across domains, it is essential to break these silos. A way to achieve the purpose is sensor virtualization, discovery and data restitution. In this paper, a federation of FIT IoT-LAB within OpenIoT is presented. OpenIoT is a middleware that enables the collection of data streams from multiple heterogeneous geographically dispersed data sources, as well as their semantic unification and streaming with a cloud infrastructure. Future Internet of Things IoT-LAB (FIT IoT-LAB) provides a very large scale infrastructure facility suitable for testing small wireless sensor devices and heterogeneous communicating objects.

a0185d4f32dde88aa1749f3a8000ed4721787b65;Visual Transformers: Token-based Image Representation and Processing for Computer Vision;Computer vision has achieved great success using standardized image representations -- pixel arrays, and the corresponding deep learning operators -- convolutions. In this work, we challenge this paradigm: we instead (a) represent images as a set of visual tokens and (b) apply visual transformers to find relationships between visual semantic concepts. Given an input image, we dynamically extract a set of visual tokens from the image to obtain a compact representation for high-level semantics. We then use visual transformers to operate over the visual tokens to densely model relationships between them. We find that this paradigm of token-based image representation and processing drastically outperforms its convolutional counterparts on image classification and semantic segmentation. To demonstrate the power of this approach on ImageNet classification, we use ResNet as a convenient baseline and use visual transformers to replace the last stage of convolutions. This reduces the stage's MACs by up to 6.9x,;['3130257', '1490695028', '4527324', '144546548', '2918780', '1680165', '1732330', '48682997'];['Bichen Wu', 'Chenfeng Xu', 'Xiaoliang Dai', 'Alvin Wan', 'Peizhao Zhang', 'M.

The mobile terminals (MTs) in different service areas form different populations. In addition, the competition among populations of MTs in different service areas is to share the limited amount of bandwidth and computation resources in the accessible service providers (SPs). We analyse the stability property of the evolutionary game model and obtain the evolutionary equilibrium (EE). EE is acquired by replicator dynamics approach. Simulation results show that our JRA-EG algorithm can converge to the EE rapidly.

b7dfca646ac61ec85c8e015828a05c77f2d7d22f;Self-Supervised Pretraining of 3D Features on any Point-Cloud;Pretraining on large labeled datasets is a prerequisite to achieve good performance in many computer vision tasks like image recognition, video understanding etc. However, pretraining is not widely used for 3D recognition tasks where state-of-the-art methods train models from scratch. A primary reason is the lack of large annotated datasets because 3D data labelling is time-consuming. Recent work shows that self-supervised learning is useful to pretrain models in 3D but requires multi-view data and point correspondences. We present a simple self-supervised pretraining method that can work with single-view depth scans acquired by varied sensors, without 3D registration and point correspondences. We pretrain standard point cloud and voxel based model architectures, and show that joint pretraining further improves performance.

cfa1b66cc49e5c0b1e630614d0b12347351cab24;Flexible and Efficient Authenticated Key Agreement Scheme for BANs Based on Physiological Features;In Body Area Networks (BANs), bio-sensors can collect personal health information and cooperate with each other to provide intelligent health care services for medical users. Since personal health information is highly privacy-sensitive, the flourish of BANs still faces critical security challenges, especially secure communication between bio-sensors. In this paper, we propose a flexible and efficient authenticated key agreement scheme (PBAKA) to provide secure communication for BANs. Specifically, we employ a control unit (e.g., smart phone) to launch authentication based on physiological features collected from BANs, and integrate bilinear pairings to negotiate session keys for bio-sensors. Since physiological features can be collected from various kinds of bio-sensors in real time, PBAKA is flexible for adding new bio-sensors without pre-distributed keys.

1fe1033a508caa43dea180f4faa135c57d931752;Plasticine: A reconfigurable architecture for parallel patterns;Reconfigurable architectures have gained popularity in recent years as they allow the design of energy-efficient accelerators. Fine-grain fabrics (e.g. FPGAs) have traditionally suffered from performance and power inefficiencies due to bit-level reconfigurable abstractions. Both fine-grain and coarse-grain architectures (e.g. CGRAs) traditionally require low level programming and suffer from long compilation times. We address both challenges with Plasticine, a new spatially reconfigurable architecture designed to efficiently execute applications composed of parallel patterns. Parallel patterns have emerged from recent research on parallel programming as powerful, high-level abstractions that can elegantly capture data locality, memory access patterns, and parallelism across a wide range of dense and sparse applications. We motivate Plasticine by first observing key application characteristics captured by parallel patterns that are amenable to hardware acceleration, such as hierarchical parallelism, data locality, memory access patterns, and control flow. Based on these observations, we architect Plasticine as a collection of Pattern Compute Units;['2688640', '49889441', '2179980', '1629760440', '1657530687', '2543429', '9182159', '117272782', '1746638'];['R.

To address the problem, we investigate a novel computation offloading scheme based on the MEC offloading framework in vehicular networks. Firstly, the utility of VTs for offloading their computation tasks is presented, where the utility is jointly determined by the execution time, computation resources and the energy for completing the computation tasks. Next, with the theoretical analysis of the utility, the QoE of each VT can be guaranteed. Then, combined with the pricing scheme of the MEC servers, we propose an efficient distributed computation offloading algorithm to make the optimal offloading decisions for;['47362015', '47008023', '3450079'];['Qiaorong Liu', 'Zhou Su', 'Yilong Hui'];fe526af8-da0b-4a52-925c-e0e345537a7e;International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing;conference;8;2018.0;São Paulo;;;;;['Computer Science'];[]

Cloud applications have different composition, configuration, and deployment requirements. Quantifying the performance of resource allocation policies and application scheduling algorithms at finer details in Cloud computing environments for different application and service models under varying load, energy performance (power consumption, heat dissipation), and system size is a challenging problem to tackle. To simplify this process, in this paper we propose CloudSim: an extensible simulation toolkit that enables modelling and simulation of Cloud computing environments.

The approach builds on a 3D perception pipeline to annotate doors and their handles solely from sensed laser data, without any a priori model learning. In particular, we segment the parts of interest using robust geometric estimators and statistical methods applied on geometric and intensity distribution variations in the scan. We present experimental results on a mobile manipulation platform (PR2) intended for indoor manipulation tasks.

9f51b01697729e046632d9575968524eaef00920;Improving the Scalability of Data Center Networks with Traffic-aware Virtual Machine Placement;The scalability of modern data centers has become a practical concern and has attracted significant attention in recent years. In contrast to existing solutions that require changes in the network architecture and the routing protocols, this paper proposes using traffic-aware virtual machine (VM) placement to improve the network scalability. By optimizing the placement of VMs on host machines, traffic patterns among VMs can be better aligned with the communication distance between them, e.g. VMs with large mutual bandwidth usage are assigned to host machines in close proximity. We formulate the VM placement as an optimization problem and prove its hardness. We design a two-tier approximate algorithm that efficiently solves the VM placement problem for very large problem sizes. Given the significant difference in the traffic patterns seen in current data centers and the structural differences of the recently proposed data center architectures, we further conduct a comparative analysis on the;['2579290', '144536688', '153824195'];['Xiaoqiao Meng', 'V.

In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form.

Hadoop is an open-source implementation of MapReduce enjoying wide adoption and is often used for short jobs where low response time is critical. Hadoop's performance is closely tied to its task scheduler, which implicitly assumes that cluster nodes are homogeneous and tasks make progress linearly, and uses these assumptions to decide when to speculatively re-execute tasks that appear to be stragglers. In practice, the homogeneity assumptions do not always hold. An especially compelling setting where this occurs is a virtualized data center, such as Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). We show that Hadoop's scheduler can cause severe performance degradation in heterogeneous environments. We design a new scheduling algorithm, Longest Approximate Time to End (LATE), that is highly robust to heterogeneity. LATE can improve Hadoop response times by a factor;['143834867', '2371549', '1687701', '38793222', '2326149473'];['M. Zaharia', 'A. Konwinski', 'A. Joseph', 'R.

In this work, we present a novel method to obtain meaningful representations of 3D shapes that can be used for clustering and reconstruction. Contrary to existing methods for 3D point cloud generation that train separate decoupled models for representation learning and generation, our approach is the first end-to-end solution that allows to simultaneously learn a latent space of representation and generate 3D shape out of it. To achieve this goal, we extend a deep Adversarial Autoencoder model (AAE) to accept 3D input and create 3D output. Thanks to our end-to-end training regime, the resulting method called 3D Adversarial Autoencoder (3dAAE) obtains either binary or continuous latent space that covers much wider portion of training data distribution, hence allowing smooth interpolation between the shapes.

This paper presents a new point cloud upsampling network called PU-GAN, which is formulated based on a generative adversarial network (GAN), to learn a rich variety of point distributions from the latent space and upsample points over patches on object surfaces. To realize a working GAN network, we construct an up-down-up expansion unit in the generator for upsampling point features with error feedback and self-correction, and formulate a self-attention unit to enhance the feature integration. Further, we design a compound loss with adversarial, uniform and reconstruction terms, to encourage the discriminator to learn more latent patterns and enhance the output point distribution uniformity. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the quality of our results over the state-of-the-arts in terms of distribution uniformity, proximity-to-surface, and 3D reconstruction quality.;['1795197', None, '144856288', '1388323541', '1714602'];['Ruihui Li', 'Xianzhi Li', 'Chi-Wing Fu', 'D.

However, by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in, limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales.

ceb2ebef0b41e31c1a21b28c2734123900c005e2;A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks;We propose an alternative generator architecture for generative adversarial networks, borrowing from style transfer literature. The new architecture leads to an automatically learned, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes (e.g., pose and identity when trained on human faces) and stochastic variation in the generated images (e.g., freckles, hair), and it enables intuitive, scale-specific control of the synthesis. The new generator improves the state-of-the-art in terms of traditional distribution quality metrics, leads to demonstrably better interpolation properties, and also better disentangles the latent factors of variation. To quantify interpolation quality and disentanglement, we propose two new, automated methods that are applicable to any generator architecture. Finally, we introduce a new, highly varied and high-quality dataset of human faces.;['2976930', '36436218', '1761103'];['Tero Karras', 'S.

The Amazon.com platform, which provides services for many web sites worldwide, is implemented on top of an infrastructure of tens of thousands of servers and network components located in many datacenters around the world. At this scale, small and large components fail continuously and the way persistent state is managed in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems. This paper presents the design and implementation of Dynamo, a highly available key-value storage system that some of Amazon's core services use to provide an ""always-on"" experience.

In this paper we address critical gaps in first-generation serverless computing, which place its autoscaling potential at odds with dominant trends in modern computing: notably data-centric and distributed computing, but also open source and custom hardware. Put together, these gaps make current serverless offerings a bad fit for cloud innovation and particularly bad for data systems innovation.

49f6bcda210e7a60a0f4584dcf6cbcc8a041d0e8;Wirelessly Powered Crowd Sensing: Joint Power Transfer, Sensing, Compression, and Transmission;Leveraging massive numbers of sensors in user equipment as well as opportunistic human mobility, mobile crowd sensing (MCS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, where prolonging battery life of constrained devices and motivating human involvement are two key design challenges. To address these, we envision a novel framework, named wirelessly powered crowd sensing (WPCS), which integrates MCS with wireless power transfer for supplying the involved devices with extra energy and thus facilitating user incentivization. This paper considers a multiuser WPCS system where an access point (AP) transfers energy to multiple mobile sensors (MSs), each of which performing data sensing, compression, and transmission. Assuming lossless (data) compression, an optimization problem is formulated to simultaneously maximize data utility and minimize energy consumption at the operator side, by jointly controlling wireless-power allocation at the AP as well as sensing-data sizes, compression ratios, and sensor-transmission durations at the MSs.

ece3b623232c90bb8a9021a3eb25223c4fde7069;Learning Deep Embeddings with Histogram Loss;We suggest a new loss for learning deep embeddings. The key characteristics of the new loss is the absence of tunable parameters and very good results obtained across a range of datasets and problems. The loss is computed by estimating two distribution of similarities for positive (matching) and negative (non-matching) point pairs, and then computing the probability of a positive pair to have a lower similarity score than a negative pair based on these probability estimates. We show that these operations can be performed in a simple and piecewise-differentiable manner using 1D histograms with soft assignment operations. This makes the proposed loss suitable for learning deep embeddings using stochastic optimization. The experiments reveal favourable results compared to recently proposed loss functions.;['145754674', '1740145'];['E. Ustinova', 'V.

The approach basically has no new inventions, which is combined from MoCo v2 and BYOL and tuned to achieve reasonably high accuracy on ImageNet-1K linear evaluation: 72.8% and 75.0% top-1 accuracy using DeiT-S and Swin-T, respectively, by 300-epoch training. The performance is slightly better than recent works of MoCo v3 and DINO which adopt DeiT as the backbone, but with much lighter tricks. More importantly, the general-purpose Swin Transformer backbone enables us to also evaluate the learnt representations on downstream tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation, in contrast to a few recent approaches built on ViT/DeiT which only report linear evaluation results on ImageNet-1K due to ViT/DeiT not tamed for these dense prediction tasks.

In this paper we propose a 3D graph neural network (3DGNN) that builds a k-nearest neighbor graph on top of 3D point cloud. Each node in the graph corresponds to a set of points and is associated with a hidden representation vector initialized with an appearance feature extracted by a unary CNN from 2D images. Relying on recurrent functions, every node dynamically updates its hidden representation based on the current status and incoming messages from its neighbors. This propagation model is unrolled for a certain number of time steps and the final per-node representation is used for predicting the semantic class of each pixel. We use back-propagation through time to train the model.

Thus, detecting various cyber-attacks or anomalies in a network and building an effective intrusion detection system that performs an essential role in today’s security is becoming more important. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning techniques, can be used for building such a data-driven intelligent intrusion detection system. In order to achieve this goal, in this paper, we present an Intrusion Detection Tree (“IntruDTree”) machine-learning-based security model that first takes into account the ranking of security features according to their importance and then build a tree-based generalized intrusion detection model based on the selected important features.

As a significant portion of the IoT market is composed of both security- and energy-critical sectors, e.g., smart homes and e-health, there is a pressing demand for solutions to secure billions of IoT devices while minimizing energy footprint. To this end, this article proposes a transport layer security (TLS) extension to integrate a lightweight and self-monitored mechanism that dynamically balances communication security and power consumption according to the IoT device’s current battery level. Integrated within the TLSv1.3 protocol, the secure extension automatically adjusts the encryption round number of the negotiated cipher according to an operator-defined policy while ensuring the minimum required security level.

Within this work, we consider the use of reinforcement learning as an online controller that adjusts DER Volt/Var and Volt/Watt control logic to mitigate network voltage unbalance. We specifically focus on the case where a network-aware cyber-physical attack has compromised a subset of single-phase DER, causing a large voltage unbalance.

Cyber-attacks aim to disrupt, block, delete, manipulate or steal the data held in these networks, which challenge these countries’ national security. Consequently, cybersecurity programs must be developed to protect these networks from cyber-attacks in a manner that is similar to operations against terrorism. This study presents several models that analyze a contest between a network operator (defender) that deploys costly detectors to protect the network and a capable cyber attacker. Generally, when the deployed detectors become more potent or the defender exhibits higher vigilance, the attacker allocates more resources to R&D to ensure that the attack remains covert. We show that detectors may be substitutes, complements, or even degrade each other, implying that defenders must account for the cyber weapons’ characteristics and the attacker’s profile and strategic behavior. We derive the optimal number of detectors;['2005724057', '97349943'];['Amitai Gilad', 'A. Tishler'];;;;;;;s4iovsbc;Defence and Peace Economics;2023.0;34;[];[]

Cloud provides demand-based services to users over the internet on pay-as-you-go basis. Fog handles real-time requests that are received from smart devices. Millions of requests arrive at the cloud-fog layer, often leading to overloaded virtual machines (VMs). Load balancing (LB) is an important issue for cloud-fog systems and has been proved to be an NP-hard problem. It is essential as it distributes the load equally among VMs to properly utilize resources and improve quality of service (QoS). Therefore, this paper presents a complete classification of LB algorithms and also a comprehensive study using heuristic, meta-heuristic, and hybrid approaches in cloud and fog computing environments.

56f751e56cb6ae7eecacdcceb258131a03b9e24f;ANVIL: Anomaly-based Vulnerability Identification without Labelled Training Data;Supervised learning-based software vulnerability detectors often fall short due to the inadequate availability of labelled training data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, are not trained on labelled data, but when prompted to detect vulnerabilities, LLM prediction accuracy is only marginally better than random guessing. In this paper, we explore a different approach by reframing vulnerability detection as one of anomaly detection. Since the vast majority of code does not contain vulnerabilities and LLMs are trained on massive amounts of such code, vulnerable code can be viewed as an anomaly from the LLM's predicted code distribution, freeing the model from the need for labelled data to provide a learnable representation of vulnerable code. Leveraging this perspective, we demonstrate that LLMs trained for code generation exhibit a significant gap in prediction accuracy when prompted to reconstruct vulnerable versus non-vulnerable code. Using this insight, we implement ANVIL, a detector;['2317930232', '2237167773', '2318901694', '2317963448'];['Weizhou Wang', 'Eric Liu', 'Xiangyu Guo', 'David Lie'];;;;;;;fp2y3ei6;ArXiv;2024.0;abs/2408.16028;['Computer Science'];['ecd0b23e4828fca585a05eff56563852d35858d9']

5ba46bd7084dfd41ce4f34deffd414e2e74cb973;Secure framework against cyber attacks on cyber-physical robotic systems;Abstract. Robot-based platforms and processes have integrated the security and efficiency of data into a comprehensive range for domains, such as manufacturing, industrial, logistical, agricultural, healthcare, and internet services. Smart cyberattacks have been on the rise, specifically targeting corporate, industrial robotic systems. These attacks execute once the internet of things, internet, and organization integration is implemented with the industrial units. We implemented security criteria-based indices for cyber-physical systems (CPS) with industrial components and embedded sensors that process the information logs and processes. We proposed an attack tree-based secure framework that does not include every CPS device but takes into consideration the critical exploitable vulnerabilities to execute the attacks. We categorized each physical device and integrated sensors based on logs and information in a sensor indices device library. This research simulated real-time exploitation of vulnerabilities on CPS robotic systems using the proposed framework in form of a two-phased process.

722a0024a864b98b0388ac52a5b266b9f26a8272;Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection Systems in IoT Using Deep Learning: A Systematic Literature Review;The Internet of Things (IoT) concept has emerged to improve people’s lives by providing a wide range of smart and connected devices and applications in several domains, such as green IoT-based agriculture, smart farming, smart homes, smart transportation, smart health, smart grid, smart cities, and smart environment. However, IoT devices are at risk of cyber attacks. The use of deep learning techniques has been adequately adopted by researchers as a solution in securing the IoT environment. Deep learning has also successfully been implemented in various fields, proving its superiority in tackling intrusion detection attacks. Due to the limitation of signature-based detection for unknown attacks, the anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) gains advantages to detect zero-day attacks. In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR) is presented to analyze the existing published literature regarding anomaly-based intrusion detection, using deep learning techniques in securing IoT environments.

30c5c481ded2686e21ce108925d4ecf9d0c62d05;The impact of generative artificial intelligence on socioeconomic inequalities and policy making;Abstract Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to both exacerbate and ameliorate existing socioeconomic inequalities. In this article, we provide a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary overview of the potential impacts of generative AI on (mis)information and three information-intensive domains: work, education, and healthcare. Our goal is to highlight how generative AI could worsen existing inequalities while illuminating how AI may help mitigate pervasive social problems. In the information domain, generative AI can democratize content creation and access but may dramatically expand the production and proliferation of misinformation. In the workplace, it can boost productivity and create new jobs, but the benefits will likely be distributed unevenly. In education, it offers personalized learning, but may widen the digital divide. In healthcare, it might improve diagnostics and accessibility, but could deepen pre-existing inequalities.

During the pandemic, cyber criminals and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups have taken advantage of targeting vulnerable people and systems. This paper emphasizes that there is a correlation between the pandemic and the increase in cyber‐attacks targeting sectors that are vulnerable. In addition, the growth in anxiety and fear due to the pandemic is increasing the success rate of cyber‐attacks. We also highlight that healthcare organizations are one of the main victims of cyber‐attacks during the pandemic. The pandemic has also raised the issue of cybersecurity in relation to the new normal of expecting staff to work from home (WFH), the possibility of state‐sponsored attacks, and increases in phishing and ransomware. We have also provided various practical approaches to reduce the risks of cyber‐attacks while WFH including mitigation of security risks related to healthcare. It is;['3031134', '34794489'];['B.

c0f3072aeab373fd64c98126afe1b3964ed3438d;Chatbots in a Honeypot World;Question-and-answer agents like ChatGPT offer a novel tool for use as a potential honeypot interface in cyber security. By imitating Linux, Mac, and Windows terminal commands and providing an interface for TeamViewer, nmap, and ping, it is possible to create a dynamic environment that can adapt to the actions of attackers and provide insight into their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The paper illustrates ten diverse tasks that a conversational agent or large language model might answer appropriately to the effects of command-line attacker. The original result features feasibility studies for ten model tasks meant for defensive teams to mimic expected honeypot interfaces with minimal risks. Ultimately, the usefulness outside of forensic activities stems from whether the dynamic honeypot can extend the time-to-conquer or otherwise delay attacker timelines short of reaching key network assets like databases or confidential information.

However, existing methods often exhibit important limitations in terms of the quantity and relevance of the generated alerts. Recently, knowledge graphs are finding application in the cybersecurity domain, showing the potential to alleviate some of these drawbacks thanks to their ability to seamlessly integrate data from multiple domains using human-understandable vocabularies. We discuss the application of machine learning on knowledge graphs for intrusion detection and experimentally evaluate a link-prediction method for scoring anomalous activity in industrial systems. After initial unsupervised training, the proposed method is shown to produce intuitively well-calibrated and interpretable alerts in a diverse range of scenarios, hinting at the potential benefits of relational machine learning on knowledge graphs for intrusion detection purposes.;['2028412', '19322337', '2097712328'];['J.

These crimes receive very little attention from the criminal justice system and very few are brought to justice, partly because of the nature of them (global crimes), but also because of a lack of capability among the police. This paper draws on official statistics, an empirical survey and interview research with computer misuse victims. The paper juxtaposes the low priority and lack of resources given to this crime by political and police leaders against many victims’ perceptions and experiences of the crime as equivalent if not more serious than physical counterparts such as burglary, where there is greater interest.

An analysis of ways to equalize the energy and power balance was carried out, and the advantages of using electricity storage systems in electrical networks was assessed. Upon simulation using the Power Factory program, we noted that, after switching on the load, a transient process occurs, characterized by a jump in active power, which was caused by the need for time to initiate the electric energy storage system. However, immediately after this, the process of issuing the accumulated energy to the electrical network and compensating for energy consumption began. Moreover, when the load was disconnected, there is a certain dip in the active power curve and a further increase in consumption. This was found to be due to the transition of the electricity;['2309191126', '2072357181', '2086894665', '2329747178', '31716080', '26607347'];['O. Miroshnyk', 'O.

This 2.6B parameter neural network is simply trained to minimize perplexity of the next token. We also propose a human evaluation metric called Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA), which captures key elements of a human-like multi-turn conversation. Our experiments show strong correlation between perplexity and SSA. The fact that the best perplexity end-to-end trained Meena scores high on SSA (72% on multi-turn evaluation) suggests that a human-level SSA of 86% is potentially within reach if we can better optimize perplexity. Additionally, the full version of Meena (with a filtering mechanism and tuned decoding) scores 79% SSA, 23% higher in absolute SSA than the existing chatbots we evaluated.;['1490889580', '1707242', '48165870', '2115876918', '22640071', '9501591', '2111906350', '1490888815', '2064494954', '2141538599', '2827616'];['Daniel De Freitas', 'Minh-Thang Luong', 'David R.

1ec63b25e4075007d3fb38f12276a731cfbf366f;Using Knowledge Graphs and Reinforcement Learning for Malware Analysis;Machine learning algorithms used to detect attacks are limited by the fact that they cannot incorporate the back-ground knowledge that an analyst has. This limits their suitability in detecting new attacks. Reinforcement learning is different from traditional machine learning algorithms used in the cybersecurity domain. Compared to traditional ML algorithms, reinforcement learning does not need a mapping of the input-output space or a specific user-defined metric to compare data points. This is important for the cybersecurity domain, especially for malware detection and mitigation, as not all problems have a single, known, correct answer. Often, security researchers have to resort to guided trial and error to understand the presence of a malware and mitigate it.In this paper, we incorporate prior knowledge, represented as Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs (CKGs), to guide the exploration of an RL algorithm to detect malware.

163b4d6a79a5b19af88b8585456363340d9efd04;GPT-4 Technical Report;We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.;['2275249853', '2275250875', '144517868', '2274773568', '2258629', '2275244794', '2275252021', '2275252424', '2275245579', '2275246437', '2275139370', '2256699302', '2054519183', '2275251659', '47626612', '2275198557', '2275251620', '2275245092', '4689792', '2275245414', '2275245581', '133740015', '2275251674', '2275246071', '2275248137', '2275245419', '2065151121', '2275219628', '35167962', '2146257251', '2275157286', '2274782053', '2275245404', '2275246368', '2275120298', '144114446', '1466431052', '2275545855', '2057091285', '2253841704', '2275188918', '2275179180', '2275289833', '2108828435', '1490681878', '2275251158', '2276186593', '2275839391', '2275231534', '49645091', '2276187456', '2275251205', '2275244920', '2275247090', '2275251200', '2275244298', '35363891', '2275252295', '2275245491', '66821245', '2275245457', '2146257131', '2065430571', '2096916416', '2275249996', '2275245820', '2275244914', '2275251173', '2027599537', '2275200811', '2275254804', '2275144649', '2325028819', '2261041177', '2158366935', '2265066144', '2275250003', '145565184', '2275247307', '2275137274', '2253699903', '2276101257', '2004021329', '2275540338', '2275295848', '2275226809', '2275245527', '2151087994', '2242286342', '2226452668', '2275246148', '2275245339', '103681415', '2275214107', '2275210604', '2275777049', '39378983', '2276187117', '2171110177', '2151094350', '2253471334', '2275172062', '2275752035', '2275203081', '2275250083', '2275247096', '35450887', '2403754', '2275230678', '2275169038', '3151440', '2844898', '2152264064', '2275246102', '2260346092', '2149054292', '2275296777', '2275112980', '51131802', '2146257375', '1485556711', '2275246094', '1666171360', '2275252322', '2275245594', '2064404342', '2275229877', '2275247085', '2275246287', '2274915115', '2990741', '52152632', '2275256930', '2275285124', '2275176375', '2275759230', '2253840098', '1380985420', '2275248327', '2257272397', '2275245628', '119341078', '2275245649', '46430291', '14113256', '2275245336', '2114362965', '2275231822', '2275247045', '39593364', '2047820455', '3028785', '2274772421', '2275234856', '2275210659', '2275132306', '10698483', '2275246330', '2275252694', '2051714782', '2275245453', '1404556973', '3407880', '2275154456', '2117715631', '147746767', '2275246116', '3422774', '7406311', '2057426488', '2072676', '2273886618', '2275115983', '2228518120', '1435765036', '2713380', '34800652', '2275244652', '2275246178', '50213542', '2275245818', '2275245435', '2274774915', '2068123790', '2275125663', '2275245529', '2275250075', '2136008481', '1463773776', '2275246346', '2275246814', '144401061', '2275150061', '146162186', '2151088845', '2275243930', '2285654208', '38909097', '2275178294', '2261024614', '2275225165', '2275252438', '2275252095', '2275207240', '11150265', '2275250007', '2260406867', '47204843', '2275246803', '2852106', '144864359', '2275265666', '2252874293', '47971768', '2196579', '2275244711', '102475503', '2275246834', '118335789', '67311962', '2700360', '2064673055', '2151735251', '2275252299', '2117680841', '103422608', '2901424', '2307592658', '2275245668', '9927844', '2275252251', '1701686', '2275750817', '145950540', '2151289331', '2275252092', '2267339677', '2275249879', '2275249709', '2275244171', '2065005836', '2275203310', '2275244586', '2275245661', '153387869', '2275245962', '2275528432', '2275540420', '2275189326', '2170081200', '2253952872', '2275244218', '2275245663', '2930640', '2275139180', '2065741038', '2275252154', '2275249733', '2059411355', '2275244177', '2275225207', '2275245771', '2275299848', '2274911253', '2307456650', '2275190169', '2275452480', '2275310096', '2275593618', '2275194186', '2563432', '49629836', '2262080679', '2275288889', '2275545682', '2275257857', '2275201537', '2275245715', '2368067'];"['OpenAI Josh Achiam', 'Steven Adler', 'Sandhini Agarwal', 'Lama Ahmad', 'Ilge Akkaya', 'Florencia Leoni Aleman', 'Diogo Almeida', 'Janko Altenschmidt', 'Sam Altman', 'Shyamal Anadkat', 'Red Avila', 'Igor Babuschkin', 'S.

ee65885ef31a56a008dde6a2a403accd196448fb;A Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System for IoT Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs);The demand for electric vehicles (EVs) is growing rapidly. This requires an ecosystem that meets the user’s needs while preserving security. The rich data obtained from electric vehicle stations are powered by the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. This is achieved through us of electric vehicle charging station management systems (EVCSMSs). However, the risks associated with cyber-attacks on IoT systems are also increasing at the same pace. To help in finding malicious traffic, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a vital role in traditional IT systems. This paper proposes a classifier algorithm for detecting malicious traffic in the IoT environment using machine learning. The proposed system uses a real IoT dataset derived from real IoT traffic. Multiple classifying algorithms are evaluated. Results were obtained on both binary and multiclass traffic models. Using the proposed algorithm in the IoT-based IDS engine that serves electric vehicle charging stations will bring stability and eliminate;['2071785604', '47460271', '9483953', '2228490'];['Mohamed Elkashlan', 'Mahmoud Said Elsayed', 'A.

There are many known cases of malicious open source packages posing risks to developers and end users. However, while efforts are made to detect vulnerable open source packages, malicious packages are not yet considered explicitly. In order to tackle this problem we perform an exploratory case study on previously occurred attacks on the software supply chain with respect to observable artifacts created. Based on gained insights, we propose Buildwatch, a framework for dynamic analysis of software and its third-party dependencies. We noticed that malicious packages introduce a significant amount of new artifacts during installation when compared to benign versions of the same package. The paper presents a first analysis of observable artifacts of malicious packages as well as a possible mitigation strategy that might lead to more insight in long term.;['51178698', '51127456', '145504199'];['Marc Ohm', 'Arnold Sykosch', 'M.

However, the traditional modeling, optimization, and control technologies have many limitations in processing the data; thus, the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the smart grid are becoming more apparent. This survey presents a structured review of the existing research into some common AI techniques applied to load forecasting, power grid stability assessment, faults detection, and security problems in the smart grid and power systems. It also provides further research challenges for applying AI technologies to realize truly smart grid systems. Finally, this survey presents opportunities of applying AI to smart grid problems. The paper concludes that the applications of AI techniques can enhance and improve the reliability and resilience of smart grid systems.";['1946878', '2059125895'];['O.

We present initial work on developing a framework to detect and extract information about vulnerabilities and attacks from Web text. Our prototype system uses Wikitology, a general purpose knowledge base derived from Wikipedia, to extract concepts that describe specific vulnerabilities and attacks, map them to related concepts from DBpedia and generate machine understandable assertions. Such a framework will be useful in adding structure to already existing vulnerability descriptions as well as detecting new ones. We evaluate our approach against vulnerability descriptions from the National Vulnerability Database. Our results suggest that it can be useful in monitoring streams of text from social media or chat rooms to identify potential new attacks and vulnerabilities or to collect data on the spread and volume of existing ones.;['1805399', '2145236245', '2286265039', '144121212', '144494232'];['Varish Mulwad', 'Wenjia Li', 'A.

Resource management in IIoT is a challenging issue, starting from the deployment and design of sensor nodes, networking at cross-layer, networking software development, application types, environmental conditions, monitoring user decisions, querying process, etc. In this article, computational intelligence (CI) and its computing, such as neural networks and fuzzy logic, are used to tackle the challenges of resource management in the IIoT. The incorporation of the neuro-fuzzy technique into the IIoT contributes to the self-managing intelligence systems’ self-organizing and self-sustaining capabilities, offering real-time computations and services in a pervasive networking environment. Most of the problems in IIoT are real-time based; they require fast computation, real-time optimal solutions, and the need to be adaptive to the situation of the events and data traffic to achieve the desired goals.";['73372272', '1410064789', '2115316285', '49128514'];['Premkumar Chithaluru', 'F.

Providing comprehensive evidence of their dependability under change represents a major open challenge. In this article, we exploit the notion of equilibrium, that is, the ability of the system to maintain an acceptable behavior within its multidimensional viability zone and propose RUNE2 (RUNtime Equilibrium verification and Enforcement), an approach able to verify at runtime the equilibrium condition and to enforce the system to stay in its viability zone. RUNE2 includes (i) a system specification that takes into account the uncertainties related to partial knowledge and possible changes; (ii) the computation of the equilibrium condition to define the boundaries of the viability zone; (iii) a runtime equilibrium verification method that leverages Bayesian inference to reason about the ability of the system to remain viable; and (iv) a resilience enforcement mechanism that exploits the posterior";['2579936', '1806346', '1736956'];['Matteo Camilli', 'R.

Although significant research thrust is prevalent on this topic, a detailed review covering the impact, status, and prospects of artificial intelligence (AI) in the manufacturing sector has been ignored in the literature. Therefore, this review provides comprehensive information on smart mechanisms and systems emphasizing additive, subtractive and/or hybrid manufacturing processes in a collaborative, predictive, decisive, and intelligent environment. Relevant electronic databases were searched, and 248 articles were selected for qualitative synthesis. Our review suggests that significant improvements are required in connectivity, data sensing, and collection to enhance both subtractive and additive technologies, though the pervasive use of AI by machines and software helps to automate processes.

However, despite many research studies in different fields (e.g. psychology, health, and design), few have sought to jointly examine the critical aspects of utility (i.e., benefits brought by these devices), privacy, and security (i.e., risks and vulnerabilities associated with them). To fill this gap, we reviewed 236 studies that researched the benefits of using WATs, the implications for the privacy of users of WATs, and the security vulnerabilities of these devices. Our survey revealed that these devices expose users to several threats. For example, WAT data can be mined to infer private information, such as the personality traits of the user. Whereas many works propose empirical findings about users’ privacy perceptions and their behaviors in relation to privacy, we found relatively few studies researching technologies to better protect users’ privacy with these devices.

The utilization of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is a result of the advent of enormous volumes of messages delivered over the internet. The IoT botnet assault, which attempts to perform genuine, lucrative, and effective cybercrimes, is one of the most critical IoT dangers. To identify and prevent botnet assaults on connected computers, this study uses both quantitative and qualitative approaches. This study employs three basic machine learning (ML) techniques—random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and generalized linear model (GLM)—and a stacking ensemble model to detect botnets in computer network traffic. The results reveled that random forest attained the best performance with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9977, followed by decision tree with an R2 of 0.9882, while GLM was the worst among the basic machine learning models with an R2 of;['2183661270', '1903895', '71758631', '1689115', '83589790'];['S.

d78a2e6155fc9afd927850ca2d58f7b790a470dd;Reformulating Domain Adaptation of Large Language Models as Adapt-Retrieve-Revise;While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have recently demonstrated astonishing zero-shot capabilities in general domain tasks, they often generate content with hallucinations in specific domains such as Chinese law, hindering their application in these areas. This is typically due to the absence of training data that encompasses such a specific domain, preventing GPT-4 from acquiring in-domain knowledge. A pressing challenge is that it's not plausible to continue training LLMs of such scale on in-domain data. This paper introduces a simple and effective domain adaptation framework for GPT-4 by reformulating generation as an \textbf{adapt-retrieve-revise} process. The initial step is to \textbf{adapt} an affordable 7B LLM to the target domain by continuing learning on in-domain data. When solving a task, we leverage the adapted LLM to generate a draft answer given a task query. Then, the draft answer will be used to \textbf{retrieve} supporting evidence candidates from an external in-domain knowledge;['2163526362', '2254820744', '2193659022', '49412583', '1795664'];['Zhen Wan', 'Yating Zhang', 'Yexiang Wang', 'Fei Cheng', 'S.

aa0b5821458e34d35d96ba0878b595950ec8bb8e;LogPrompt: Prompt Engineering Towards Zero-Shot and Interpretable Log Analysis;Automated log analysis plays a crucial role in software maintenance as it allows for efficient identification and resolution of issues. How-ever, traditional methods employed in log analysis heavily rely on extensive historical data for training purposes and lack rationales for its predictions. The performance of these traditional methods significantly deteriorates when in-domain logs for training are lim-ited and unseen log data are the majority, particularly in rapidly changing online environments. Additionally, the lack of rationales hampers the interpretability of analysis results and impacts analysts' subsequent decision-making processes. To address these challenges, we proposes LogPrompt, an novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and advanced prompting techniques to achieve performance improvements in zero-shot scenarios (i.e., no in-domain training). Moreover, LogPrompt has garnered positive evaluations from experienced practitioners in its log interpretation ability.

However, in supply chain management where multilevel partnerships exist universally, a pure symmetric encryption scheme cannot provide efficient data sharing and fine-grained access control. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a secure data sharing scheme (SDSM) for IoT based supply chains by combining blockchain and ciphertext-based attribute cryptography. This scheme supports the enforcement of fine-grained access control for different levels of partnerships. In addition, to identify partnerships, we propose a metric based on the historical transaction facts on the blockchain, where the level of partnerships among participants is automatically calculated by smart contracts. Finally, we introduce personalized attributes of participants in the ciphertext-based attribute encryption algorithm to support the construction of access policies that include partnerships, allowing for more fine-grained;['2051263050', '2105556504', '2151631318'];['Chuntang Yu', 'Yongzhao Zhan', 'Muhammad Sohail'];;;;;;;2j7fv0ew;Symmetry;2022.0;14;['Computer Science'];['98ec4a0080f897c7ba4b6840a7403b1eae2a55aa', 'b6b7fea1846e85ac1e3c7e3adda6e65b127d0368']

Cyber warfare has emerged as the fifth operational warfighting domain. India has been strengthening its cyber warfare capabilities for a long time, which can seriously affect Pakistan. Considering the theoretical constructs of Barry Buzan and Ole Waever regarding the broader concept of security, this paper aims to highlight the possible threats and security challenges that India's cyberspace can pose to Pakistan's national security. The paper argues that India has acquired a robust cyberspace that can potentially cause financial damage, political instability, societal unrest, and radicalisation in Pakistan's society. Furthermore, strong cyberspace can also challenge nuclear deterrence between the two neighbours, thus threatening military security. The paper concludes with recommendations regarding what Pakistan can do to mitigate this growing cyber threat.

In a successful false data injection attack, the attacker manipulates the measurements from the grid sensors such that undetected errors are introduced into the estimates of the system parameters leading to catastrophic situations. This article proposes a novel perturbation based false data injection attack detection mechanism that utilizes inverter based distributed energy resources (DERs) to create low magnitude perturbation signal in the distribution system voltage that is inconsequential to the normal grid operation. Two voltage sensitivity analysis based algorithms are designed to identify the optimal set of DERs that can create the voltage perturbation signal of desired magnitude. An analytical method of voltage sensitivity analysis is used to compute the magnitude of voltage perturbation signal at each node in a computationally efficient manner.

MusiLingo employs a single projection layer to align music representations from the pre-trained frozen music audio model MERT with a frozen LLM, bridging the gap between music audio and textual contexts. We train it on an extensive music caption dataset and fine-tune it with instructional data. Due to the scarcity of high-quality music Q&A datasets, we created the MusicInstruct (MI) dataset from captions in the MusicCaps datasets, tailored for open-ended music inquiries. Empirical evaluations demonstrate its competitive performance in generating music captions and composing music-related Q&A pairs. Our introduced dataset enables notable advancements beyond previous ones.;['4692365', '2146277129', '2242966052', '2242959918', '2143853895', '2928777', '2239245627', '2109397'];['Zihao Deng', 'Yi Ma', 'Yudong Liu', 'Rongchen Guo', 'Ge Zhang', 'Wenhu Chen', 'Wenhao Huang', 'Emmanouil Benetos'];;;;;;;77a8qmx4;Engineering Review (2023.0);2023.0;73;['Engineering', 'Computer Science'];[]
ccd1a1d1e4694fd99e04a0154ecaafebe775544c;Real-Time Cost Optimization Approach Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning in Software-Defined Security Middle Platform;In today’s business environment, reducing costs is crucial due to the variety of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and security infrastructure. However, applying security measures to complex business scenarios can lead to performance degradation, making it a challenging task. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for optimizing cost in multi-party computation software-defined security middle platforms (MPC-SDSmp) in real-time. To accomplish this, we first integrate fragmented security requirements and infrastructure into the MPC-SDSmp cloud model with privacy protection capabilities to reduce deployment costs. By leveraging the power of DRL and cloud computing technology, we enhance the real-time matching and dynamic adaptation capabilities of the security middle platform (Smp). This enables us to generate a real-time scheduling strategy for Smp resources that meet low-cost goals to reduce operating costs. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only reduces the costs by;['47003064', '2171767050'];['Yuancheng Li', 'Yongtai Qin'];;;;;;;2czfmtcs;Inf.;2023.0;14;['Computer Science'];[]
4177ec52d1b80ed57f2e72b0f9a42365f1a8598d;Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks;Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful model for sequential data. End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates deep recurrent neural networks, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score.;['1753223', '40360972', '1695689'];['Alex Graves', 'Abdel-rahman Mohamed', 'Geoffrey E.

In the real world, people use various kinds of smartphone apps differently in different contexts that include both the user-centric context and device-centric context. In the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning, decision tree model is one of the most popular approaches for predicting context-aware smartphone usage. However, real-life smartphone apps usage data may contain higher dimensions of contexts, which may cause several issues such as increases model complexity, may arise over-fitting problem, and consequently decreases the prediction accuracy of the context-aware model.

Such CTI currently requires extensive expert input for obtaining, assessing, and correlating system vulnerabilities into a graphical representation, often referred to as an attack graph (AG). Instead of deriving AGs based on system vulnerabilities, this work advocates the direct use of intrusion alerts. We propose SAGE, an explainable sequence learning pipeline that automatically constructs AGs from intrusion alerts without a priori expert knowledge. SAGE exploits the temporal and probabilistic dependence between alerts in a suffix-based probabilistic deterministic finite automaton (S-PDFA) — a model that brings infrequent severe alerts into the spotlight and summarizes paths leading to them. Attack graphs are extracted from the model on a per-victim, per-objective basis. SAGE is thoroughly evaluated on three open-source intrusion alert datasets collected through security testing competitions in order to analyze distributed multi-stage attacks.

Many techniques and procedures have been developed in order to reach a level of security like data encryption, data backup, data masking, etc., which may require high initial costs and maintenance. Also, once sensitive data has been masked, it cannot be changed back to its original form. Cryptography can be used for data security by data encryption and decryption. One can quickly discover the existence of concealed information in carrier files by employing cryptography. The strategy used in this project utilizes cryptographic methods. In cryptography, the proposed method uses AES algorithm. This helps to maintain the data in a secure way. Cryptography is used to conceal the data in any text file document by utilizing the AES technique. This ensures that no other network user can access the information that is protected.

7522862ab073d3e25ba28e46eed42a36de0c9310;Application of Artificial Intelligence for EV Charging and Discharging Scheduling and Dynamic Pricing: A Review;The high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) will burden the existing power delivery infrastructure if their charging and discharging are not adequately coordinated. Dynamic pricing is a special form of demand response that can encourage EV owners to participate in scheduling programs. Therefore, EV charging and discharging scheduling and its dynamic pricing model are important fields of study. Many researchers have focused on artificial intelligence-based EV charging demand forecasting and scheduling models and suggested that artificial intelligence techniques perform better than conventional optimization methods such as linear, exponential, and multinomial logit models. However, only a few research studies focused on EV discharging scheduling (i.e., vehicle-to-grid, V2G) because the concept of EV discharging electricity back to the power grid is relatively new and evolving. Therefore, a review of existing EV charging and discharging-related studies is needed to understand the research gaps and to make some improvements in future studies.

f73c5f51f4edbb5f6ee7e5c1c6c75231dedaa758;LICALITY—Likelihood and Criticality: Vulnerability Risk Prioritization Through Logical Reasoning and Deep Learning;Security and risk assessment aims to prioritize detected vulnerabilities for remediation in a computer networking system. The widely used expert-based risk prioritization approach, e.g., Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), cannot realistically associate vulnerabilities to the likelihood of exploitation. The CVSS metrics are calculated from static formulas, and cannot easily integrate attackers’ motivations and capabilities w.r.t. the network environmental factors. To address this issue, this paper proposes LICALITY, a vulnerability risk prioritization system. LICALITY captures the attacker’s preference on exploiting vulnerabilities through a threat modeling method, and learns threat attributes that contribute to the exploitation of vulnerability. LICALITY creatively uses a neuro-symbolic model, with neural network (NN) and probabilistic logic programming (PLP) techniques, to learn such threat attributes. The risk of vulnerability is assessed from the criticality of exploitation and the likelihood of exploitation. LICALITY consolidates these two measurements by using a logic reasoning engine. In the evaluation, the historical threat;['2075414409', '2729091', '34577327', '2112882047'];['Zhen Zeng', 'Zhun Yang', 'Dijiang Huang', 'Chun-Jen Chung'];;;;;;;q5jskigr;IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management;2022.0;19;['Deep Learning', 'Computer Science'];['a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8', 'e84b50da644a624f9bc7e51f96db2fbf656c0357']

To address these defects, Automated Program Repair (APR) has been developed to fix bugs automatically. With the advent of Large Language Models, Code Language Models (CLMs) trained on code corpora excels in code generation, making them suitable for APR applications. Despite this progress, a significant limitation remains: many bugs necessitate multi-point edits for repair, yet current CLM-based APRs are restricted to single-point bug fixes, which severely narrows the scope of repairable bugs. Moreover, these tools typically only consider the direct context of the buggy line when building prompts for the CLM, leading to suboptimal repair outcomes due to the limited information provided. This paper introduces a novel approach, ARJA-CLM, which integrates the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with CLM to fix multilocation bugs in Java projects. We also propose a context-aware prompt construction stratege, which enriches the prompt with additional information;['2316551564', '2316518243', '2316521114', '2316568253'];['Yunan Wang', 'Tingyu Guo', 'Zilong Huang', 'Yuan Yuan'];;;;;;;y9of8lg7;ArXiv;2024.0;abs/2408.10486;['Computer Science'];[]

CIPHER was trained using over 300 high-quality write-ups of vulnerable machines, hacking techniques, and documentation of open-source penetration testing tools augmented in an expert response structure. Additionally, we introduced the Findings, Action, Reasoning, and Results (FARR) Flow augmentation, a novel method to augment penetration testing write-ups to establish a fully automated pentesting simulation benchmark tailored for large language models.

Measures taken to increase cybersecurity are aimed at the robustness and resilience of specific systemic entities in society. We argue that this does not necessarily mean that systems in which these entities are embedded become more robust or resilient. The article investigates the objectives of 20 projects funded by different public organizations to increase cybersecurity of critical infrastructures. The findings show that robustness and resilience are addressed by these projects on different layers of systems in society, without a clear picture of how they are supposed to fit together in a wider effort to protect society against disruption. The detailed analysis of the different facets of robustness and resilience addressed in cybersecurity projects paves the way for a better understanding of this problem.

Information is found in semi-structured vulnerability databases as well as in text from security bulletins, news reports, cyber security blogs and Internet chat rooms. It can be useful to cyber security systems if there is a way to recognize and extract relevant information and represent it as easily shared and integrated semantic data. We describe such an automatic framework that generates and publishes a RDF linked data representation of cyber security concepts and vulnerability descriptions extracted from the National Vulnerability Database and from text sources. A CRF-based system is used to identify cybersecurity-relatedentities, concepts and relations in text, which are then represented using custom ontologies for the cyber security domain and also mapped to objects in the DBpedia knowledge base.

APT poses severe threats to the resource-limited edge devices in advanced networks. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) conducts data analysis on attack strategies by artificial intelligence (AI) and generates threat intelligence to optimize the detection model and guide defense strategies. However, AI lacks explanations for the decisions and thus reduces the transparency and performance of the detection model. Besides, the tradeoff between the detection accuracy and the computational resource limitation of edge devices needs an optimal and rapid dynamic resource allocation method, which edge game and AI can help. In this article, we propose an explainable intelligence-driven APT edge defense mechanism. The proposed mechanism provides guidelines and explanations for designing the defense strategy and resource allocation scheme of the edge defender to detect APT.

f092a9b51ccaddc64064585e077683a1067dc90e;Enhancing Automated Program Repair with Solution Design;Automatic Program Repair (APR) endeavors to autonomously rectify issues within specific projects, which generally encompasses three categories of tasks: bug resolution, new feature development, and feature enhancement. Despite extensive research proposing various methodologies, their efficacy in addressing real issues remains unsatisfactory. It’s worth noting that, typically, engineers have design rationales (DR) on solution— planed solutions and a set of underlying reasons—before they start patching code. In open-source projects, these DRs are frequently captured in issue logs through project management tools like Jira. This raises a compelling question: How can we leverage DR scattered across the issue logs to efficiently enhance APR?To investigate this premise, we introduce DRCodePilot, an approach designed to augment GPT-4-Turbo’s APR capabilities by incorporating DR into the prompt instruction.

7b85a5c5c7586c2fd9228fa5255e8e8b075e3f97;Using Digital Twin to Detect Cyber-Attacks in Industrial Control Systems;The digital transition is largely impacting industrial control systems. The integration of information and communication technologies in industrial control systems on the one hand is improving the related functionalities, on the other hand is increasing the related vulnerabilities and the attack surfaces of industrial systems. This results in the non-negligible need for protection of the operational and production processes. Although many tools are available from the Information Technology sector, these are currently not appropriate to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the industrial domain. As a consequence, it is crucial to investigate the proper strategies and methodologies to guarantee the protection of industrial control systems. In this context, this paper aims at defining a novel tool for the detection of cyber-attacks in industrial control systems, which is based on the implementation of a virtual model for both the physical and the control layers to detect attacks.

Despite their crucial role, the development of smart contracts may introduce vulnerabilities and potentially lead to severe consequences, such as financial losses. Meanwhile, large language models, represented by ChatGPT, have gained great attentions, showcasing great capabilities in code analysis tasks. In this paper, we presented an empirical study to investigate the performance of ChatGPT in identifying smart contract vulnerabilities. Initially, we evaluated ChatGPT's effectiveness using a publicly available smart contract dataset. Our findings discover that while ChatGPT achieves a high recall rate, its precision in pinpointing smart contract vulnerabilities is limited. Furthermore, ChatGPT's performance varies when detecting different vulnerability types. We delved into the root causes for the false positives generated by ChatGPT, and categorized them into four groups. Second, by comparing ChatGPT with other state-of-the-art smart contract vulnerability detection tools, we found that;['2239163419', '2182871981', '3413969', '2239164852', '2239102139', '2239164852', '2239162646', '2239103211', '2239197567'];['Chong Chen', 'J.

However, advancements in quantum computing would empower such adversaries to perform more computations in a shorter time span, leading to a major security crisis. Integrating artificial intelligence based approaches that are hard problems such as natural language understanding or CAPTCHA can help with future-proofing security. Hence, this work proposes a CAPTCHA-like challenge that adds AI-Hardness to authenticate the client password. In the proposed system, no information about the password is directly sent in client-server communication and cannot be captured by adversaries. Server generates a challenge text and sends it to the client, which is then hashed with the client password. The output is embedded into an image and is XORed twice with the hash generated with the client password and sent to the server. This introduces randomness in the image.

8f1a5a51c50b33af10348495bcecee98ccd30ac1;Attack Graph Model for Cyber-Physical Power Systems Using Hybrid Deep Learning;Electrical power grids are vulnerable to cyber attacks, as seen in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016. However, existing attack detection methods are limited. Most of them are based on power system measurement anomalies that occur when an attack is successfully executed at the later stages of the cyber kill chain. In contrast, the attacks on the Ukrainian power grid show the importance of system-wide, early-stage attack detection through communication-based anomalies. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method for online cyber attack situational awareness that enhances the power grid resilience. It supports power system operators in the identification and localization of active attack locations in Operational Technology (OT) networks in near real-time. The proposed method employs a hybrid deep learning model of Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (GC-LSTM) and a deep convolutional network for time series classification-based anomaly detection. It is implemented as a combination of software defined networking,;['49534433', '10795766', '31618106', '1846124'];['Alfan Presekal', 'Alexandru Ştefanov', 'V. Rajkumar', 'P.

4d5ed385b3a9b7d5d192047c54578ceeaaf2639f;Telemedicine, privacy, and information security in the age of COVID-19;COVID-19 has highlighted the shortcomings of healthcare systems globally as countries struggle to meet the high demand for patient care. The spread of COVID-19 has resulted in unprecedented circumstances that necessitate a shift towards adopting infrastructure to enable care to be provided virtually. This shift is critical to minimize insufficiencies and maximize the quality of care in healthcare systems. While COVID-19 has dramatically accelerated the adoption of technology into care delivery, ongoing work is needed to ensure that our technology infrastructure provides an environment for safe and effective care delivery. Telemedicine usage has substantially increased over the past decade (1), and many hospital systems have robust telemedicine programs. Yet traditional in-person visits remain the cornerstone of clinical care, despite the fact that a significant amount of these visits, including follow-ups, treatment for minor illnesses, and chronic disease management could be substituted by virtual communication.

GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures.

36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478;Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks;We present a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data that is based on an efficient variant of convolutional neural networks which operate directly on graphs. We motivate the choice of our convolutional architecture via a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. Our model scales linearly in the number of graph edges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph structure and features of nodes. In a number of experiments on citation networks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach outperforms related methods by a significant margin.;['41016725', '1678311'];['Thomas Kipf', 'M.

In contrast with existing methods, our work does not require computationally expensive higher-order representations in intermediate layers while it still achieves competitive or better performance. In addition, whereas existing methods are limited to equivariance on 3 dimensional spaces, our model is easily scaled to higher-dimensional spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on dynamical systems modelling, representation learning in graph autoencoders and predicting molecular properties.;['73240341', '65928943', '1678311'];['Victor Garcia Satorras', 'Emiel Hoogeboom', 'M.

An improved version of an algorithm for finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph and at algorithm for finding the biconnected components of an undirect graph are presented. The space and time requirements of both algorithms are bounded by $k_1 V + k_2 E + k_3 $ for some constants $k_1 ,k_2 $, and $k_3 $, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges of the graph being examined.;['1721050'];['R.

967a21a111757d6af7f7a25ca7ea2bdf6d505098;Deep Graph Infomax;We present Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), a general approach for learning node representations within graph-structured data in an unsupervised manner. DGI relies on maximizing mutual information between patch representations and corresponding high-level summaries of graphs---both derived using established graph convolutional network architectures. The learnt patch representations summarize subgraphs centered around nodes of interest, and can thus be reused for downstream node-wise learning tasks. In contrast to most prior approaches to unsupervised learning with GCNs, DGI does not rely on random walk objectives, and is readily applicable to both transductive and inductive learning setups. We demonstrate competitive performance on a variety of node classification benchmarks, which at times even exceeds the performance of supervised learning.;['3444569', '26958176', '49437682', '144269589', '1751762', '40482726'];['Petar Velickovic', 'W.

00b7efbf14a54cced4b9f19e663b70ffbd01324b;Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network;Graph neural network, as a powerful graph representation technique based on deep learning, has shown superior performance and attracted considerable research interest. However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its meta-path based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance;['2118449003', '51111816', '144123161', '1735282', '143738684', '152297693', '7873409'];['Xiao Wang', 'Houye Ji', 'C.

2a9fbca9dc6badbeedc591ad829c5c6e0f950fd6;Graph Contrastive Learning with Augmentations;Generalizable, transferrable, and robust representation learning on graph-structured data remains a challenge for current graph neural networks (GNNs). Unlike what has been developed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image data, self-supervised learning and pre-training are less explored for GNNs. In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) framework for learning unsupervised representations of graph data. We first design four types of graph augmentations to incorporate various priors. We then systematically study the impact of various combinations of graph augmentations on multiple datasets, in four different settings: semi-supervised, unsupervised, and transfer learning as well as adversarial attacks. The results show that, even without tuning augmentation extents nor using sophisticated GNN architectures, our GraphCL framework can produce graph representations of similar or better generalizability, transferrability, and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also investigate the impact of parameterized graph augmentation extents and patterns, and observe further performance gains in;['89197162', '2648459', '2003767516', '145358498', '2969311', '1705610299'];['Yuning You', 'Tianlong Chen', 'Yongduo Sui', 'Ting Chen', 'Zhangyang Wang', 'Yang Shen'];d9720b90-d60b-48bc-9df8-87a30b9a60dd;Neural Information Processing Systems;conference;17;2020.0;Paris;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science'];['3302081b8878de505b69900e22b8137c5d931be7', '639206a9a32d91386924f1c94e9760dfb43df72e', '04faf433934486c41d082e8d75ccfe5dc2f69fef', '91fb815361fdbf80ff15ce4d783a41846bd99232', '4f68caebe510a0d737759ee648daa3de4fc98627', 'ac2e6afbadc3428eb5dff167b52025e64525441e', 'b9c8c93c6112687d25525b996dc951fb845e8648', '1f3c381eedfe8914b81e93070bfdb00cf86ac943', '597bd2e45427563cdf025e53a3239006aa364cfc', 'c1040296c9aa7a5c5651749f0e98ba768fe4e68b', '789a7069d1a2d02d784e4821685b216cc63e6ec8', '4ce9c20642dce5eb7930966053a1e3da4ef617f2', '62ed9bf1d83c8db1f9cbf92ea2f57ea90ef683d9', '967a21a111757d6af7f7a25ca7ea2bdf6d505098', 'b8da4337c92acda632e8138be1b525a3aef54b85', 'af3825437b627db1a99f946f7aa773ba8b03befd', 'b227f3e4c0dc96e5ac5426b85485a70f2175a205', 'd18b48f77eb5c517a6d2c1fa434d2952a1b0a825', '6c44f8e62d824bcda4f291c679a5518bbd4225f6', 'e4715a13f6364b1c81e64f247651c3d9e80b6808', 'bb17ff968ae1dbd772ac337f469d1ca915cb4c03', '36652428740cd30d245d55889f01a7fb04a91c93', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', 'e24cdf73b3e7e590c2fe5ecac9ae8aa983801367', '54906484f42e871f7c47bbfe784a358b1448231f', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '36ee2c8bd605afd48035d15fdc6b8c8842363376', 'ea9d2a2b4ce11aaf85136840c65f3bc9c03ab649']
de02ec03f6a71246e505862a7195894601fbab99;KGAT: Knowledge Graph Attention Network for Recommendation;To provide more accurate, diverse, and explainable recommendation, it is compulsory to go beyond modeling user-item interactions and take side information into account. Traditional methods like factorization machine (FM) cast it as a supervised learning problem, which assumes each interaction as an independent instance with side information encoded. Due to the overlook of the relations among instances or items (e.g., the director of a movie is also an actor of another movie), these methods are insufficient to distill the collaborative signal from the collective behaviors of users. In this work, we investigate the utility of knowledge graph (KG), which breaks down the independent interaction assumption by linking items with their attributes. We argue that in such a hybrid structure of KG and user-item graph, high-order relations --- which connect two items with one or multiple linked attributes --- are an essential factor for successful recommendation. We propose a new method;['98285513', '7792071', '2112867078', '2152972434', '144078686'];['Xiang Wang', 'Xiangnan He', 'Yixin Cao', 'Meng Liu', 'Tat-Seng Chua'];a0edb93b-1e95-4128-a295-6b1659149cef;Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining;conference;12;2019.0;London;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['1bc2d0de52a77ad5e30d735be5a067c7bed24f9d', 'c5f5f179d80a3bf9b4f29750283a87eaca42e91b', '2335a95bfed617953675b5227cc881707746f53b', '5aadc803228b70c3cc6b31e332770d47d7fb1e6e', '74c2878df89fcc2be28eae8523757d6d491457ea', '54575fec0a24ea3daf1512e209ba4fab4c3d53f0', 'a6a735f8e218f772e5b9dac411fa4abea87fdb9c', '833a6052983fa55181b92516d0e1097d74585c58', 'd0f1809dc696134fb8fb2a3ff5a982eeacdc7127', '61c8169aba4e754976f012fd056bf9076c5b7421', '0cfac458b176a1e81879aff4344c5278114cc171', '9fa3e53b5937a0ec92499ed415e339ede6c92010', '5aea95e1ae78a66474051a330ded374e199b658c', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726', 'a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8', '2582ab7c70c9e7fcb84545944eba8f3a7f253248', 'ea9d2a2b4ce11aaf85136840c65f3bc9c03ab649']

This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between ""hand-engineering"" and ""end-to-end"" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths.";['2019153', '2158860', '2603033', '1398105826', '3133079', '145478807', '2844530', '143724694', '35030998', None, '1854385', '2107148568', '5055381', '2058362', '35188630', '40348417', '145254624', '36942233', '2066201331', '1745899', '2801204', '1688276', '143967473', '46378362', '1689108', '47002813', '1996134'];['P.

In this paper, we propose a new neural network model, called graph neural network (GNN) model, that extends existing neural network methods for processing the data represented in graph domains. This GNN model, which can directly process most of the practically useful types of graphs, e.g., acyclic, cyclic, directed, and undirected, implements a function tau(G,n) isin IRm that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n into an m-dimensional Euclidean space. A supervised learning algorithm is derived to estimate the parameters of the proposed GNN model. The computational cost of the proposed algorithm is also considered. Some experimental results are shown to validate the proposed learning algorithm, and to demonstrate its generalization capabilities.;['47260481', '145467467', '1733691', '1784450', '3073217'];['F.

36652428740cd30d245d55889f01a7fb04a91c93;Deeper Insights into Graph Convolutional Networks for Semi-Supervised Learning;Many interesting problems in machine learning are being revisited with new deep learning tools. For graph-based semi-supervised learning, a recent important development is graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which nicely integrate local vertex features and graph topology in the convolutional layers. Although the GCN model compares favorably with other state-of-the-art methods, its mechanisms are not clear and it still requires considerable amount of labeled data for validation and model selection. In this paper, we develop deeper insights into the GCN model and address its fundamental limits. First, we show that the graph convolution of the GCN model is actually a special form of Laplacian smoothing, which is the key reason why GCNs work, but it also brings potential concerns of over-smoothing with many convolutional layers. Second, to overcome the limits of the GCN model with shallow architectures, we propose both co-training and self-training approaches to train GCNs. Our approaches significantly improve;['35692225', '40592359', '19195265'];['Qimai Li', 'Zhichao Han', 'Xiao-Ming Wu'];bdc2e585-4e48-4e36-8af1-6d859763d405;AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence;conference;6;2018.0;Paris;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['69906b74ee369cd25522ec432ecbc601a77c9d87', '5e7d57cd826801f626eb399a9254bd8c90427559', '0e779fd59353a7f1f5b559b9d65fa4bfe367890c', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '3d846cb01f6a975554035d2210b578ca61344b22', '0811597b0851b7ebe21aadce7cb4daac4664b44f', '815c84ab906e43f3e6322f2ca3fd5e1360c64285', 'cddf8a10c7f48df67a797808a615be0d4acf9a8e', 'fff114cbba4f3ba900f33da574283e3de7f26c83', 'ea9d2a2b4ce11aaf85136840c65f3bc9c03ab649']
c5f5f179d80a3bf9b4f29750283a87eaca42e91b;Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering;Learning vector representations (aka. embeddings) of users and items lies at the core of modern recommender systems. Ranging from early matrix factorization to recently emerged deep learning based methods, existing efforts typically obtain a user's (or an item's) embedding by mapping from pre-existing features that describe the user (or the item), such as ID and attributes. We argue that an inherent drawback of such methods is that, the collaborative signal, which is latent in user-item interactions, is not encoded in the embedding process. As such, the resultant embeddings may not be sufficient to capture the collaborative filtering effect. In this work, we propose to integrate the user-item interactions - more specifically the bipartite graph structure - into the embedding process. We develop a new recommendation framework Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF), which exploits the user-item graph structure by propagating embeddings on it. This leads to the expressive modeling of high-order;['98285513', '7792071', '2146058320', '2163400298', '144078686'];['Xiang Wang', 'Xiangnan He', 'Meng Wang', 'Fuli Feng', 'Tat-Seng Chua'];8dce23a9-44e0-4381-a39e-2acc1edff700;Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval;conference;17;2019.0;Beijing;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science'];['ca064483ce24c92b738a16a33d4eeb4541bdd9f6', 'de02ec03f6a71246e505862a7195894601fbab99', 'cd89cc9a83ac2dd0639d7b452de1f9540271f274', '2335a95bfed617953675b5227cc881707746f53b', '0933564925aee8e761db53657033182f65a46735', '74c2878df89fcc2be28eae8523757d6d491457ea', 'eb2ae9f753c4318c0a052218af0a2ba1fdfd8969', '54575fec0a24ea3daf1512e209ba4fab4c3d53f0', 'f778186c42aac4822385ce43ebaeb79ac2ea5c1f', '9fa3e53b5937a0ec92499ed415e339ede6c92010', '5aea95e1ae78a66474051a330ded374e199b658c', '6c96c2d4a3fbd572fef2d59cb856521ee1746789', '204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', 'a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8', 'ea9d2a2b4ce11aaf85136840c65f3bc9c03ab649']

3024f58826a5bce3378af94f677e8fb90cbb49e0;LightGCN: Simplifying and Powering Graph Convolution Network for Recommendation;Graph Convolution Network (GCN) has become new state-of-the-art for collaborative filtering. Nevertheless, the reasons of its effectiveness for recommendation are not well understood. Existing work that adapts GCN to recommendation lacks thorough ablation analyses on GCN, which is originally designed for graph classification tasks and equipped with many neural network operations. However, we empirically find that the two most common designs in GCNs -- feature transformation and nonlinear activation -- contribute little to the performance of collaborative filtering. Even worse, including them adds to the difficulty of training and degrades recommendation performance. In this work, we aim to simplify the design of GCN to make it more concise and appropriate for recommendation. We propose a new model named LightGCN, including only the most essential component in GCN -- neighborhood aggregation -- for collaborative filtering.

What changes there have been in a few short years! That shadowy borderland has become a thriving metropolis. International conferences on Graph Theory occur with almost embarrassing frequency. Journals on Graph Theory abound: I once counted the Editorial Offices of three of them in one of the mathematical departments of one of the Universities of one of the smaller cities of Canada. Any connection with Topology is likely to be firmly repudiated as soon as noted.

72edcb3788f9c141a3ed28e6d36f75ca4977d27e;Spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network: A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting;Timely accurate traffic forecast is crucial for urban traffic control and guidance. Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of traffic flow, traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of mid-and-long term prediction tasks and often neglect spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN), to tackle the time series prediction problem in traffic domain. Instead of applying regular convolutional and recurrent units, we formulate the problem on graphs and build the model with complete convolutional structures, which enable much faster training speed with fewer parameters. Experiments show that our model STGCN effectively captures comprehensive spatio-temporal correlations through modeling multi-scale traffic networks and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various real-world traffic datasets.;['46806278', '26379330', '1703952'];['Ting Yu', 'Haoteng Yin', 'Zhanxing Zhu'];67f7f831-711a-43c8-8785-1e09005359b5;International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence;conference;18;2017.0;Paris;;;;;['Graph', 'Deep Learning', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['9ba0186ed40656329c421f55ada7313293e13f17', '5618bb2aff7ecdb0a2ae7c57838d156f731008ff', '43428880d75b3a14257c3ee9bda054e61eb869c0', '6b1793ece5993523855ce67c646de408318d1b12', 'c52b77c18700e9625c885a824a0c8b95c3e9cf21', '6b59f34c8b1c6f44996eb305577478dd54f54249', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '7c6de5a9e02a779e24504619050c6118f4eac181', 'c9538e13bd2a0e33948feb1fce2c56c0bc0eb5d9', '94deb62af3054c49e7d80bd7eb3ed5efe990fc0b', 'a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8', '168f28ac3c8c7ea63bf7ed25f2288e8b67e2fe74']

GCNs derive inspiration primarily from recent deep learning approaches, and as a result, may inherit unnecessary complexity and redundant computation. In this paper, we reduce this excess complexity through successively removing nonlinearities and collapsing weight matrices between consecutive layers. We theoretically analyze the resulting linear model and show that it corresponds to a fixed low-pass filter followed by a linear classifier. Notably, our experimental evaluation demonstrates that these simplifications do not negatively impact accuracy in many downstream applications. Moreover, the resulting model scales to larger datasets, is naturally interpretable, and yields up to two orders of magnitude speedup over FastGCN.;['24277779', '123437034', '3383481', '2258547281', None, '7446832'];['Felix Wu', 'Tianyi Zhang', 'A.

fae129338c0899576524506008427f64477d3967;Graph WaveNet for Deep Spatial-Temporal Graph Modeling;Spatial-temporal graph modeling is an important task to analyze the spatial relations and temporal trends of components in a system. Existing approaches mostly capture the spatial dependency on a fixed graph structure, assuming that the underlying relation between entities is pre-determined. However, the explicit graph structure (relation) does not necessarily reflect the true dependency and genuine relation may be missing due to the incomplete connections in the data. Furthermore, existing methods are ineffective to capture the temporal trends as the RNNs or CNNs employed in these methods cannot capture long-range temporal sequences. To overcome these limitations, we propose in this paper a novel graph neural network architecture, {Graph WaveNet}, for spatial-temporal graph modeling. By developing a novel adaptive dependency matrix and learn it through node embedding, our model can precisely capture the hidden spatial dependency in the data.

1d81e7f428fea2b2e15ee3a96fe843ca603acc4c;Simple and Deep Graph Convolutional Networks;Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are a powerful deep learning approach for graph-structured data. Recently, GCNs and subsequent variants have shown superior performance in various application areas on real-world datasets. Despite their success, most of the current GCN models are shallow, due to the {\em over-smoothing} problem. In this paper, we study the problem of designing and analyzing deep graph convolutional networks. We propose the GCNII, an extension of the vanilla GCN model with two simple yet effective techniques: {\em Initial residual} and {\em Identity mapping}. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the two techniques effectively relieves the problem of over-smoothing. Our experiments show that the deep GCNII model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various semi- and full-supervised tasks.

b8d9b10cf54629364523ec065e6307ab87f7d4f0;iRun: Horizontal and Vertical Shape of a Region-Based Graph Compression;Graph data are pervasive worldwide, e.g., social networks, citation networks, and web graphs. A real-world graph can be huge and requires heavy computational and storage resources for processing. Various graph compression techniques have been presented to accelerate the processing time and utilize memory efficiently. SOTA approaches decompose a graph into fixed-size submatrices and compress it by applying the existing graph compression algorithm. This approach is promising if the input graph is dense. Otherwise, an optimal graph compression ratio cannot be achieved. Graphs such as those used by social networks exhibit a power-law distribution. Thus, applying compression to the fixed-size block of a matrix could lead to the empty cell processing of that matrix. In this paper, we solve the problem of ordered matrix compression on a deep level, dividing the block into sub-blocks to achieve the best compression ratio. We observe that the ordered matrix compression ratio could be improved;['2198082533', '2145419030'];['Muhammad Umair', 'Young-Koo Lee'];3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538;Italian National Conference on Sensors;conference;18;2022.0;Beijing;;;;;['Medicine', 'Graph', 'Computer Science'];['b7b951e0eee7b1ce913fbf99f2b497491054b8ee', '4dbf5ab853c74d30ce118a13d83cc2a8ccaecada', '63fa5751ba9dfb5e9d545b538a84e675a263ac03', '12d8c11f3006b09130fdd5007e30f10b09687fbe', '93808ce258f4556df9a58a145c73b872392339ed', '2426098c33ad0f897f29725b2b7bf02fa8e128e7', '5df0ced15b18103c9517805c4c0447e2af72e217', '0e692f1cab6a37c312fa58596aafa340d41b6cdc', 'a18ad95991db3f735d105ccc5caa246cd6b37d1b', 'd6ca0a9ea0e51ad099644dcbb6fe226cb7d28eeb']
492f57ee9ceb61fb5a47ad7aebfec1121887a175;Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks;Abstract: Graph-structured data appears frequently in domains including chemistry, natural language semantics, social networks, and knowledge bases. In this work, we study feature learning techniques for graph-structured inputs. Our starting point is previous work on Graph Neural Networks (Scarselli et al., 2009), which we modify to use gated recurrent units and modern optimization techniques and then extend to output sequences. The result is a flexible and broadly useful class of neural network models that has favorable inductive biases relative to purely sequence-based models (e.g., LSTMs) when the problem is graph-structured. We demonstrate the capabilities on some simple AI (bAbI) and graph algorithm learning tasks. We then show it achieves state-of-the-art performance on a problem from program verification, in which subgraphs need to be matched to abstract data structures.;['47002813', '1725299', '2107692', '1804104'];['Yujia Li', 'Daniel Tarlow', 'Marc Brockschmidt', 'R.

26aa6fe2028b5eefbaa40ab54ef725bbbe7d9810;ConceptNet 5.5: An Open Multilingual Graph of General Knowledge;Machine learning about language can be improved by supplying it with specific knowledge and sources of external information. We present here a new version of the linked open data resource ConceptNet that is particularly well suited to be used with modern NLP techniques such as word embeddings. ConceptNet is a knowledge graph that connects words and phrases of natural language with labeled edges. Its knowledge is collected from many sources that include expert-created resources, crowd-sourcing, and games with a purpose. It is designed to represent the general knowledge involved in understanding language, improving natural language applications by allowing the application to better understand the meanings behind the words people use. When ConceptNet is combined with word embeddings acquired from distributional semantics (such as word2vec), it provides applications with understanding that they would not acquire from distributional semantics alone, nor from narrower resources such as WordNet or DBPedia. We demonstrate this;['145696762', '2060230787', '2232845'];['R.

d18b48f77eb5c517a6d2c1fa434d2952a1b0a825;Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning with Differentiable Pooling;Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph representation learning through effectively learned node embeddings, and achieved state-of-the-art results in tasks such as node classification and link prediction. However, current GNN methods are inherently flat and do not learn hierarchical representations of graphs---a limitation that is especially problematic for the task of graph classification, where the goal is to predict the label associated with an entire graph. Here we propose DiffPool, a differentiable graph pooling module that can generate hierarchical representations of graphs and can be combined with various graph neural network architectures in an end-to-end fashion. DiffPool learns a differentiable soft cluster assignment for nodes at each layer of a deep GNN, mapping nodes to a set of clusters, which then form the coarsened input for the next GNN layer. Our experimental results show that combining existing GNN methods with DiffPool yields an average improvement of;['83539859', '145829303', '143622465', '145201124', '49437682', '1702139'];['Rex Ying', 'Jiaxuan You', 'Christopher Morris', 'Xiang Ren', 'William L.

d08a0eb7024dff5c4fabd58144a38031633d4e1a;Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks;Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the standard toolkit for analyzing and learning from data on graphs. As the field grows, it becomes critical to identify key architectures and validate new ideas that generalize to larger, more complex datasets. Unfortunately, it has been increasingly difficult to gauge the effectiveness of new models in the absence of a standardized benchmark with consistent experimental settings. In this paper, we introduce a reproducible GNN benchmarking framework, with the facility for researchers to add new models conveniently for arbitrary datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework by presenting a principled investigation into the recent Weisfeiler-Lehman GNNs (WL-GNNs) compared to message passing-based graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for a variety of graph tasks, i.e. graph regression/classification and node/link prediction, with medium-scale datasets.;['51235219', '38009979', '81634721', '1751762', '2549032'];['Vijay Prakash Dwivedi', 'Chaitanya K.

9697d32ed0a16da167f2bdba05ef96d0da066eb5;Convolutional 2D Knowledge Graph Embeddings;Link prediction for knowledge graphs is the task of predicting missing relationships between entities. Previous work on link prediction has focused on shallow, fast models which can scale to large knowledge graphs. However, these models learn less expressive features than deep, multi-layer models — which potentially limits performance. In this work we introduce ConvE, a multi-layer convolutional network model for link prediction, and report state-of-the-art results for several established datasets. We also show that the model is highly parameter efficient, yielding the same performance as DistMult and R-GCN with 8x and 17x fewer parameters. Analysis of our model suggests that it is particularly effective at modelling nodes with high indegree — which are common in highly-connected, complex knowledge graphs such as Freebase and YAGO3. In addition, it has been noted that the WN18 and FB15k datasets suffer from test set leakage, due to inverse relations from the training set being;['3239480', '3051815', '1918552', '48662861'];['Tim Dettmers', 'Pasquale Minervini', 'Pontus Stenetorp', 'Sebastian Riedel'];bdc2e585-4e48-4e36-8af1-6d859763d405;AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence;conference;15;2017.0;Los Angeles;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['e15d062ef07abab8fae65244f64ccd2aac8d2b94', 'cd8a9914d50b0ac63315872530274d158d6aff09', '74606b052a17dd425bcc6cd1d05db153633c742a', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '6a86696974d5d49b4b9be6bd10ffcf92f996f4db', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '50de83b8a00f448b3e344701a60dfdcfd84881f4', '2218e2e1df2c3adfb70e0def2e326a39928aacfc', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d', '23ffaa0fe06eae05817f527a47ac3291077f9e58', '955fe2ee26d888ae22749b0853981b8b581b133d', '5d1bfeed240709725c78bc72ea40e55410b373dc', 'a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8', '2582ab7c70c9e7fcb84545944eba8f3a7f253248', 'eb6208f3e2c0942e38ceffc443dcf64d2cb4ec82', 'bc1022b031dc6c7019696492e8116598097a8c12']

The success of such a task heavily relies on the ability of modeling and inferring the patterns of (or between) the relations. In this paper, we present a new approach for knowledge graph embedding called RotatE, which is able to model and infer various relation patterns including: symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition. Specifically, the RotatE model defines each relation as a rotation from the source entity to the target entity in the complex vector space. In addition, we propose a novel self-adversarial negative sampling technique for efficiently and effectively training the RotatE model. Experimental results on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that the proposed RotatE model is not only scalable, but also able to infer and model various relation patterns and significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction.;['48064856', '123580511', '143619007', '152226504'];['Zhiqing Sun', 'Zhihong Deng', 'Jian-Yun Nie', 'Jian Tang'];939c6e1d-0d17-4d6e-8a82-66d960df0e40;International Conference on Learning Representations;conference;15;2018.0;Sydney;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['41cbe3cdfee7539f8ff20144e6bd028ef762e00c', '990334cf76845e2da64d3baa10b0a671e433d4b6', '73047a0f0192a35d3b5c6f5ebeadf3706b17e4dc', '9697d32ed0a16da167f2bdba05ef96d0da066eb5', 'e9287b896a1c7360567915c3932b8df1ee4a81f7', '7bf34d65eec494a0b758f4ab3f58db8a89815e1f', '5889e9afbcc3935867f9ae16fe46c71b9f2b071f', 'c2e4d8f97d85783895db2c7066b6f3199c08c68c', 'b30481dd5467a187b7e1a5a2dd326d97cafd95ac', '6a116b897569fe4d6ea9ad4c3ba9a18825b96f49', 'c8c21f8f7d427446c11967ac967dcf500ae74078', '50de83b8a00f448b3e344701a60dfdcfd84881f4', '2218e2e1df2c3adfb70e0def2e326a39928aacfc', '955fe2ee26d888ae22749b0853981b8b581b133d', '994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726', 'a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8', '2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05', '2582ab7c70c9e7fcb84545944eba8f3a7f253248', '87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f', '1f4a4769e4d2fb846e59c2f185e0377190739f18', '1976c9eeccc7115d18a04f1e7fb5145db6b96002']

2d867297dfe0d3ce2ed5b1d0f2dff88cac46ee94;Pregel: a system for large-scale graph processing;Many practical computing problems concern large graphs. Standard examples include the Web graph and various social networks. The scale of these graphs - in some cases billions of vertices, trillions of edges - poses challenges to their efficient processing. In this paper we present a computational model suitable for this task. Programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations, in each of which a vertex can receive messages sent in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, and modify its own state and that of its outgoing edges or mutate graph topology. This vertex-centric approach is flexible enough to express a broad set of algorithms. The model has been designed for efficient, scalable and fault-tolerant implementation on clusters of thousands of commodity computers, and its implied synchronicity makes reasoning about programs easier. Distribution-related details are hidden behind an abstract API. The result is a framework for processing large graphs;['1766747', '2268793', '144211012', '2381974', '40607909', '1858799', '2911719'];['G. Malewicz', 'Matthew H. Austern', 'Aart J. C.

In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing techniques, including not only the state-of-the-arts but also those with latest trends. Particularly, we make the review based on the type of information used in the embedding task. Techniques that conduct embedding using only facts observed in the KG are first introduced. We describe the overall framework, specific model design, typical training procedures, as well as pros and cons of such techniques. After that, we discuss techniques that further incorporate additional information besides facts.

789a7069d1a2d02d784e4821685b216cc63e6ec8;Strategies for Pre-training Graph Neural Networks;Many applications of machine learning require a model to make accurate pre-dictions on test examples that are distributionally different from training ones, while task-specific labels are scarce during training. An effective approach to this challenge is to pre-train a model on related tasks where data is abundant, and then fine-tune it on a downstream task of interest. While pre-training has been effective in many language and vision domains, it remains an open question how to effectively use pre-training on graph datasets. In this paper, we develop a new strategy and self-supervised methods for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The key to the success of our strategy is to pre-train an expressive GNN at the level of individual nodes as well as entire graphs so that the GNN can learn useful local and global representations simultaneously.

The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications, where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on the existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields.

However, making these methods practical and scalable to web-scale recommendation tasks with billions of items and hundreds of millions of users remains an unsolved challenge. Here we describe a large-scale deep recommendation engine that we developed and deployed at Pinterest. We develop a data-efficient Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) algorithm, which combines efficient random walks and graph convolutions to generate embeddings of nodes (i.e., items) that incorporate both graph structure as well as node feature information. Compared to prior GCN approaches, we develop a novel method based on highly efficient random walks to structure the convolutions and design a novel training strategy that relies on harder-and-harder training examples to improve robustness and convergence of the model. We also develop an efficient MapReduce model inference algorithm to generate embeddings using a trained model.

994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726;Learning Entity and Relation Embeddings for Knowledge Graph Completion;Knowledge graph completion aims to perform link prediction between entities. In this paper, we consider the approach of knowledge graph embeddings. Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space. In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling. In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities. In experiments, we evaluate our models on three tasks including link prediction, triple classification and relational fact extraction. Experimental results show significant;['2427350', '49293587', '1753344', '2152797839', '144809121'];['Yankai Lin', 'Zhiyuan Liu', 'Maosong Sun', 'Yang Liu', 'Xuan Zhu'];bdc2e585-4e48-4e36-8af1-6d859763d405;AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence;conference;8;2015.0;Los Angeles;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science'];['2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05', '2582ab7c70c9e7fcb84545944eba8f3a7f253248', '50d53cc562225549457cbc782546bfbe1ac6f0cf', '87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f', '834cb8e1e738b8d2c6d24e652ac966d6e7089a46', 'c4fd9c86b2b41df51a6fe212406dda81b1997fd4', 'f6b51c8753a871dc94ff32152c00c01e94f90f09', 'eb6208f3e2c0942e38ceffc443dcf64d2cb4ec82', '04cc04457e09e17897f9256c86b45b92d70a401f', 'fbe358ce706371b93c10c4395cab9a78ad3aef67', '1f4a4769e4d2fb846e59c2f185e0377190739f18', '1976c9eeccc7115d18a04f1e7fb5145db6b96002']

2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05;Knowledge Graph Embedding by Translating on Hyperplanes;We deal with embedding a large scale knowledge graph composed of entities and relations into a continuous vector space. TransE is a promising method proposed recently, which is very efficient while achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. We discuss some mapping properties of relations which should be considered in embedding, such as reflexive, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. We note that TransE does not do well in dealing with these properties. Some complex models are capable of preserving these mapping properties but sacrifice efficiency in the process. To make a good trade-off between model capacity and efficiency, in this paper we propose TransH which models a relation as a hyperplane together with a translation operation on it. In this way, we can well preserve the above mapping properties of relations with almost the same model complexity of TransE.

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy.

415224a9aff759f6972189df8b7761dfd6a81154;Introduction to graph theory;In graph theory, the term graph refers to a set of vertices and a set of edges. A vertex can be used to represent any object. Graphs may contain undirected or directed edges. An undirected edge is a set of two vertices. A directed edge is an ordered pair of two vertices where the edge goes from the first vertex to the second vertex. Graphs that contain directed edges are called directed graphs or digraphs.;['1774907'];['K. Fraughnaugh'];;;;;;;1iums5ps;The Mathematical Gazette;1973.0;57;['Graph', 'Computer Science'];[]

6ea57a2aea08ce0628c93f77bdc24c2f3e9cc6da;Weisfeiler and Leman Go Neural: Higher-order Graph Neural Networks;In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful neural architecture to learn vector representations of nodes and graphs in a supervised, end-to-end fashion. Up to now, GNNs have only been evaluated empirically—showing promising results. The following work investigates GNNs from a theoretical point of view and relates them to the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman graph isomorphism heuristic (1-WL). We show that GNNs have the same expressiveness as the 1-WL in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic (sub-)graphs. Hence, both algorithms also have the same shortcomings. Based on this, we propose a generalization of GNNs, so-called k-dimensional GNNs (k-GNNs), which can take higher-order graph structures at multiple scales into account. These higher-order structures play an essential role in the characterization of social networks and molecule graphs. Our experimental evaluation confirms our theoretical findings as well as confirms that higher-order information is useful in the task of graph classification and regression.;['143622465', '8787552', '3410500', '49437682', '9572099', '3329062', '1744396'];['Christopher Morris', 'Martin Ritzert', 'Matthias Fey', 'William L.

9653d5c2c7844347343d073bbedd96e05d52f69b;Pointer Networks;We introduce a new neural architecture to learn the conditional probability of an output sequence with elements that are discrete tokens corresponding to positions in an input sequence. Such problems cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence [1] and Neural Turing Machines [2], because the number of target classes in each step of the output depends on the length of the input, which is variable. Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various combinatorial optimization problems belong to this class. Our model solves the problem of variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposed mechanism of neural attention. It differs from the previous attention attempts in that, instead of using attention to blend hidden units of an encoder to a context vector at each decoder step, it uses attention as a pointer to select a member of the input sequence as the output. We call this;['1689108', '39067762', '3111912'];['O. Vinyals', 'Meire Fortunato', 'N.

6075091294a0fe0fe5c6c7b7a0df9029b6a965cb;SE(3)-Transformers: 3D Roto-Translation Equivariant Attention Networks;We introduce the SE(3)-Transformer, a variant of the self-attention module for 3D point clouds, which is equivariant under continuous 3D roto-translations. Equivariance is important to ensure stable and predictable performance in the presence of nuisance transformations of the data input. A positive corollary of equivariance is increased weight-tying within the model, leading to fewer trainable parameters and thus decreased sample complexity (i.e. we need less training data). The SE(3)-Transformer leverages the benefits of self-attention to operate on large point clouds with varying number of points, while guaranteeing SE(3)-equivariance for robustness. We evaluate our model on a toy $N$-body particle simulation dataset, showcasing the robustness of the predictions under rotations of the input. We further achieve competitive performance on two real-world datasets, ScanObjectNN and QM9. In all cases, our model outperforms a strong, non-equivariant attention baseline and an equivariant model without attention.;['38593960', '3471551', '2144816511', '1678311'];['F. Fuchs', 'Daniel E.

6a116b897569fe4d6ea9ad4c3ba9a18825b96f49;Differentiable Learning of Logical Rules for Knowledge Base Completion;Learned models composed of probabilistic logical rules are useful for many tasks, such as knowledge base completion. Unfortunately this learning problem is difficult, since determining the structure of the theory normally requires solving a discrete optimization problem. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach: a completely differentiable model for learning sets of first-order rules. The approach is inspired by a recently-developed differentiable logic, i.e. a subset of first-order logic for which inference tasks can be compiled into sequences of differentiable operations. Here we describe a neural controller system which learns how to sequentially compose the these primitive differentiable operations to solve reasoning tasks, and in particular, to perform knowledge base completion. The long-term goal of this work is to develop integrated, end-to-end systems that can learn to perform high-level logical reasoning as well as lower-level perceptual tasks.;['47829900', '2109512754', '50056360'];['Fan Yang', 'Zhilin Yang', 'William W.

3db5fcb595492dcd64663c00d56f004dfafa689c;A Fair Comparison of Graph Neural Networks for Graph Classification;Experimental reproducibility and replicability are critical topics in machine learning. Authors have often raised concerns about their lack in scientific publications to improve the quality of the field. Recently, the graph representation learning field has attracted the attention of a wide research community, which resulted in a large stream of works. As such, several Graph Neural Network models have been developed to effectively tackle graph classification. However, experimental procedures often lack rigorousness and are hardly reproducible. Motivated by this, we provide an overview of common practices that should be avoided to fairly compare with the state of the art. To counter this troubling trend, we ran more than 47000 experiments in a controlled and uniform framework to re-evaluate five popular models across nine common benchmarks. Moreover, by comparing GNNs with structure-agnostic baselines we provide convincing evidence that, on some datasets, structural information has not been exploited yet.

To better understand the diversity and evolution of this viral group, we sequenced six novel Faustovirus strains, mined published metagenomic datasets and performed a comparative genomic analysis. Genomic sequences revealed three consistent phylogenetic groups, within which genetic diversity was moderate. The comparison of the major capsid protein (MCP) genes unveiled between 13 and 18 type-I introns that likely evolved through a still-active birth and death process mediated by intron-encoded homing endonucleases that began before the Faustovirus radiation. Genome-wide alignments indicated that despite genomes retaining high levels of gene collinearity, the central region containing the MCP gene together with the extremities of the chromosomes evolved at a faster rate due to increased indel accumulation and local rearrangements. The fluctuation of the nucleotide composition along the Faustovirus (FV) genomes is mostly;['1720865985', '80425288', '39252548', '144809304', '2716470'];['Khalil Geballa-Koukoulas', 'H.

0df63cbd6f8bb0b325d780c9c2fcef8f6670c588;Improving Graph Attention Networks with Large Margin-based Constraints;Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are the state-of-the-art neural architecture for representation learning with graphs. GATs learn attention functions that assign weights to nodes so that different nodes have different influences in the feature aggregation steps. In practice, however, induced attention functions are prone to over-fitting due to the increasing number of parameters and the lack of direct supervision on attention weights. GATs also suffer from over-smoothing at the decision boundary of nodes. Here we propose a framework to address their weaknesses via margin-based constraints on attention during training. We first theoretically demonstrate the over-smoothing behavior of GATs and then develop an approach using constraint on the attention weights according to the class boundary and feature aggregation pattern. Furthermore, to alleviate the over-fitting problem, we propose additional constraints on the graph structure. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on common benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which leads to significant;['2148300', '83539859', '49025046', '1702139'];['Guangtao Wang', 'Rex Ying', 'Jing Huang', 'J.

A particular focus has thereby been on rotation and reflection equivariant CNNs for planar images. Here we give a general description of E(2)-equivariant convolutions in the framework of Steerable CNNs. The theory of Steerable CNNs thereby yields constraints on the convolution kernels which depend on group representations describing the transformation laws of feature spaces. We show that these constraints for arbitrary group representations can be reduced to constraints under irreducible representations. A general solution of the kernel space constraint is given for arbitrary representations of the Euclidean group E(2) and its subgroups. We implement a wide range of previously proposed and entirely new equivariant network architectures and extensively compare their performances.

71bab0bb655a9bf7a7ef8a2308db1097111fd7d1;Easing Embedding Learning by Comprehensive Transcription of Heterogeneous Information Networks;Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are ubiquitous in real-world applications. In the meantime, network embedding has emerged as a convenient tool to mine and learn from networked data. As a result, it is of interest to develop HIN embedding methods. However, the heterogeneity in HINs introduces not only rich information but also potentially incompatible semantics, which poses special challenges to embedding learning in HINs. With the intention to preserve the rich yet potentially incompatible information in HIN embedding, we propose to study the problem of comprehensive transcription of heterogeneous information networks.

However, direct evidence for anatomical connectivity networks in the human brain remains scarce. Here, we utilized diffusion tensor imaging deterministic tractography to construct a macroscale anatomical network capturing the underlying common connectivity pattern of human cerebral cortex in a large sample of subjects (80 young adults) and further quantitatively analyzed its topological properties with graph theoretical approaches. The cerebral cortex was divided into 78 cortical regions, each representing a network node, and 2 cortical regions were considered connected if the probability of fiber connections exceeded a statistical criterion. The topological parameters of the established cortical network (binarized) resemble that of a ""small-world"" architecture characterized by an exponentially truncated power-law distribution. These characteristics imply high resilience to localized damage. Furthermore, this cortical network was characterized by major";['40276414', '145475635', '144962062', '2058576', '33338936', '144159535', '145667418'];['G. Gong', 'Yong He', 'L. Concha', 'C.

2426098c33ad0f897f29725b2b7bf02fa8e128e7;GraphGrind: addressing load imbalance of graph partitioning;We investigate how graph partitioning adversely affects the performance of graph analytics. We demonstrate that graph partitioning induces extra work during graph traversal and that graph partitions have markedly different connectivity than the original graph. By consequence, increasing the number of partitions reaches a tipping point after which overheads quickly dominate performance gains. Moreover, we show that the heuristic to balance CPU load between graph partitions by balancing the number of edges is inappropriate for a range of graph analyses. However, even when it is appropriate, it is sub-optimal due to the skewed degree distribution of social networks. Based on these observations, we propose GraphGrind, a new graph analytics system that addresses the limitations incurred by graph partitioning. We moreover propose a NUMA-aware extension to the Cilk programming language and obtain a scale-free yet NUMA-aware parallel programming environment which underpins NUMA-aware scheduling in GraphGrind. We demonstrate that Graph-Grind outperforms state-of-the-art;['1783012', '144114375', '1698312'];['Jiawen Sun', 'Hans Vandierendonck', 'Dimitrios S.

Existing methods mainly rely on hand-engineered features from KGs (e.g., meta paths), which requires domain knowledge. This paper presents RKGE, a KG embedding approach that automatically learns semantic representations of both entities and paths between entities for characterizing user preferences towards items. Specifically, RKGE employs a novel recurrent network architecture that contains a batch of recurrent networks to model the semantics of paths linking a same entity pair, which are seamlessly fused into recommendation. It further employs a pooling operator to discriminate the saliency of different paths in characterizing user preferences towards items. Extensive validation on real-world datasets shows the superiority of RKGE against state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that RKGE provides meaningful explanations for recommendation results.;['35040403', '2118579490', '36611093', '1710630', '2957079', '2110076328'];['Zhu Sun', 'Jie Yang', 'Jie Zhang', 'A.

The DBN model is trained in a greedy unsupervised method and fine-tuned by labeled data.

The early chapters provide tutorials for material used in later chapters, offering introductions to representation, inference and learning in graphical models, and logic. The book then describes object-oriented approaches, including probabilistic relational models, relational Markov networks, and probabilistic entity-relationship models as well as logic-based formalisms including Bayesian logic programs, Markov logic, and stochastic logic programs.

However, existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures have limited power in capturing the position/location of a given node with respect to all other nodes of the graph. Here we propose Position-aware Graph Neural Networks (P-GNNs), a new class of GNNs for computing position-aware node embeddings. P-GNN first samples sets of anchor nodes, computes the distance of a given target node to each anchor-set,and then learns a non-linear distance-weighted aggregation scheme over the anchor-sets. This way P-GNNs can capture positions/locations of nodes with respect to the anchor nodes. P-GNNs have several advantages: they are inductive, scalable,and can incorporate node feature information. We apply P-GNNs to multiple prediction tasks including link prediction and community detection. We show that P-GNNs consistently outperform state of the art GNNs, with up to 66% improvement;['145829303', '83539859', '1702139'];['Jiaxuan You', 'Rex Ying', 'J.

However, training GNNs requires abundant task-specific labeled data, which is often arduously expensive to obtain. One effective way to reduce the labeling effort is to pre-train an expressive GNN model on unlabelled data with self-supervision and then transfer the learned model to downstream tasks with only a few labels. In this paper, we present the GPT-GNN framework to initialize GNNs by generative pre-training. GPT-GNN introduces a self-supervised attributed graph generation task to pre-train a GNN so that it can capture the structural and semantic properties of the graph. We factorize the likelihood of graph generation into two components: 1) attribute generation and 2) edge generation. By modeling both components, GPT-GNN captures the inherent dependency between node attributes and graph structure during the generative process.

63fa5751ba9dfb5e9d545b538a84e675a263ac03;StarZIP: Streaming Graph Compression Technique for Data Archiving;The size of a streaming graph is possibly unbounded, and it is updated by a continuous sequence of edges over time. Due to numerous types of real-world interactions, the nature of edge arrival in a streaming graph is dynamic and holds different types of temporal subgraphs, such as stars, bipartite forms, cliques, and chains. The most current techniques find such subgraphs in each snapshot of a dynamic graph and use a dictionary or hash-based summary to compress the graph before applying a stitching technique to demonstrate its temporal behavior. However, it remains difficult to discover those subgraph structures from the continuous stream of edges found in large and rapidly changing dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose a streaming graph compression algorithm, StarZIP, that uses a new encoding scheme. Our motivational factor is real-world graphs that contain an overwhelmingly large number of stars and a few other structures.

Although existing HIN based recommendation methods have achieved performance improvement to some extent, they have two major shortcomings. First, these models seldom learn an explicit representation for path or meta-path in the recommendation task. Second, they do not consider the mutual effect between the meta-path and the involved user-item pair in an interaction. To address these issues, we develop a novel deep neural network with the co-attention mechanism for leveraging rich meta-path based context for top-N recommendation. We elaborately design a three-way neural interaction model by explicitly incorporating meta-path based context. To construct the meta-path based context, we propose to use a priority based sampling technique to select high-quality path instances.

Besides the high-cardinality issue, the interactions among such categorical variables are usually long-tailed, with the head made up of highly frequent values and a long tail of rare ones. This phenomenon results in the data sparsity issue, making it essential to regularize the models to ensure generalization. The common practice is to employ grid search to manually tune regularization hyperparameters based on the validation data. However, it requires non-trivial efforts and large computation resources to search the whole candidate space; even so, it may not lead to the optimal choice, for which different parameters should have different regularization strengths. In this paper, we propose a hyperparameter optimization method, lambdaOpt, which automatically and adaptively enforces regularization during training.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for joint representation learning of cross-lingual words and entities. It captures mutually complementary knowledge, and enables cross-lingual inferences among knowledge bases and texts. Our method does not require parallel corpus, and automatically generates comparable data via distant supervision using multi-lingual knowledge bases. We utilize two types of regularizers to align cross-lingual words and entities, and design knowledge attention and cross-lingual attention to further reduce noises. We conducted a series of experiments on three tasks: word translation, entity relatedness, and cross-lingual entity linking.

5c57bb5630835a05eb1c3d0df3e12d6180d75de2;One-Shot Imitation Learning;Imitation learning has been commonly applied to solve different tasks in isolation. This usually requires either careful feature engineering, or a significant number of samples. This is far from what we desire: ideally, robots should be able to learn from very few demonstrations of any given task, and instantly generalize to new situations of the same task, without requiring task-specific engineering. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning framework for achieving such capability, which we call one-shot imitation learning. Specifically, we consider the setting where there is a very large set of tasks, and each task has many instantiations. For example, a task could be to stack all blocks on a table into a single tower, another task could be to place all blocks on a table into two-block towers, etc. In each case, different instances of the task would consist of different sets of blocks with different initial states.;['144581158', '2206490', '3275284', '2126278', '2113526509', '1701686', '1689992', '2563432'];['Yan Duan', 'Marcin Andrychowicz', 'Bradly C.

74c2878df89fcc2be28eae8523757d6d491457ea;Explainable Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs for Recommendation;Incorporating knowledge graph into recommender systems has attracted increasing attention in recent years. By exploring the interlinks within a knowledge graph, the connectivity between users and items can be discovered as paths, which provide rich and complementary information to user-item interactions. Such connectivity not only reveals the semantics of entities and relations, but also helps to comprehend a user’s interest. However, existing efforts have not fully explored this connectivity to infer user preferences, especially in terms of modeling the sequential dependencies within and holistic semantics of a path.In this paper, we contribute a new model named Knowledgeaware Path Recurrent Network (KPRN) to exploit knowledge graph for recommendation. KPRN can generate path representations by composing the semantics of both entities and relations. By leveraging the sequential dependencies within a path, we allow effective reasoning on paths to infer the underlying rationale of a user-item interaction.

The page rank of a collection of Web pages can be represented in a parameterized model, and the user requirements can be represented by a set of constraints. For a particular parameterization, namely, a linear combination of the page ranks produced by different forcing functions, and user requirements represented by a set of linear constraints, the problem can be solved using a quadratic programming method. The solution to this problem produces a set of parameters which can be used for ranking all pages in the Web. We show that the method is suitable for building customized versions of PageRank which can be readily adapted to the needs of a vertical search engine or that of a single user.;['1733691', '1784450', '47260481'];['A.

Besides, many of the people who analyze this data are entrenched procedural programmers, who find the declarative, SQL style to be unnatural. The success of the more procedural map-reduce programming model, and its associated scalable implementations on commodity hardware, is evidence of the above. However, the map-reduce paradigm is too low-level and rigid, and leads to a great deal of custom user code that is hard to maintain, and reuse.

However, current relevance computing based on meta-graph only considers the complex structural information, but ignores its embedded meta-paths information. To address this problem, we proposeMEta-GrAph-based network embedding models, called MEGA and MEGA++, respectively. The MEGA model uses normalized relevance or similarity measures that are derived from a meta-graph and its embedded meta-paths between nodes simultaneously, and then leverages tensor decomposition method to perform node embedding. The MEGA++ further facilitates the use of coupled tensor-matrix decomposition method to obtain a joint embedding for nodes, which simultaneously considers the hidden relations of all meta information of a meta-graph. Extensive experiments on two real datasets demonstrate that MEGA and MEGA++ are more effective than state-of-the-art approaches.;['46732871', '40901820', '50823909', '1678185', '47414558', '2336542', '144019071'];['Lichao Sun', 'Lifang He', 'Zhipeng Huang', 'Bokai Cao', 'Congying Xia', 'Xiaokai Wei', 'Philip S.

However, common to most existing work, words are regarded as independent entities without any explicit relationship among morphologically related words being modeled. As a result, rare and complex words are often poorly estimated, and all unknown words are represented in a rather crude way using only one or a few vectors. This paper addresses this shortcoming by proposing a novel model that is capable of building representations for morphologically complex words from their morphemes. We combine recursive neural networks (RNNs), where each morpheme is a basic unit, with neural language models (NLMs) to consider contextual information in learning morphologicallyaware word representations. Our learned models outperform existing word representations by a good margin on word similarity tasks across many datasets, including a new dataset we introduce focused on rare words to complement;['1821711', '2166511', '144783904'];['Thang Luong', 'R.

However, current research focuses on proposing and evaluating specific architectural designs of GNNs, as opposed to studying the more general design space of GNNs that consists of a Cartesian product of different design dimensions, such as the number of layers or the type of the aggregation function. Additionally, GNN designs are often specialized to a single task, yet few efforts have been made to understand how to quickly find the best GNN design for a novel task or a novel dataset. Here we define and systematically study the architectural design space for GNNs which consists of 315,000 different designs over 32 different predictive tasks. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) A general GNN design space; (2) a GNN task space with a similarity metric, so that for";['145829303', '83539859', '1702139'];['Jiaxuan You', 'Rex Ying', 'J.

ea9d2a2b4ce11aaf85136840c65f3bc9c03ab649;Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks;Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural;['3119801', '1751762'];['Xavier Glorot', 'Yoshua Bengio'];2d136b11-c2b5-484b-b008-7f4a852fd61e;International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics;conference;19;2010.0;São Paulo;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Neural Networks'];[]

We introduce the Tree-LSTM, a generalization of LSTMs to tree-structured network topologies.

9ae75ab09a9c0db08c5ec6a02ae940128f41e016;A Neural Influence Diffusion Model for Social Recommendation;Precise user and item embedding learning is the key to building a successful recommender system. Traditionally, Collaborative Filtering (CF) provides a way to learn user and item embeddings from the user-item interaction history. However, the performance is limited due to the sparseness of user behavior data. With the emergence of online social networks, social recommender systems have been proposed to utilize each user's local neighbors' preferences to alleviate the data sparsity for better user embedding modeling. We argue that, for each user of a social platform, her potential embedding is influenced by her trusted users, with these trusted users are influenced by the trusted users' social connections. As social influence recursively propagates and diffuses in the social network, each user's interests change in the recursive process. Nevertheless, the current social recommendation models simply developed static models by leveraging the local neighbors of each user without simulating the recursive diffusion in;['2688093', '3685571', '2274395', '48043335', '2108045320', '2146058571'];['Le Wu', 'Peijie Sun', 'Yanjie Fu', 'Richang Hong', 'Xiting Wang', 'Meng Wang'];8dce23a9-44e0-4381-a39e-2acc1edff700;Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval;conference;12;2019.0;London;;;;;['Computer Science'];['f778186c42aac4822385ce43ebaeb79ac2ea5c1f', '9fa3e53b5937a0ec92499ed415e339ede6c92010', '6c96c2d4a3fbd572fef2d59cb856521ee1746789', 'ecf6c42d84351f34e1625a6a2e4cc6526da45c74', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', 'ace1059fd85bbb8b41874a47a029bba7899124a5', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f']

Unlike for other families of the networks, the representation power of GNNs has much room for improvement, and many graph networks to date suffer from the problem of underfitting. In this paper we will introduce a Graph Warp Module, a supernode-based auxiliary network module that can be attached to a wide variety of existing GNNs in order to improve the representation power of the original networks. Through extensive experiments on molecular graph datasets, we will show that our GWM indeed alleviates the underfitting problem for various existing networks, and that it can even help create a network with the state-of-the-art generalization performance.;['1969064', '35647224', '2877296'];['Katsuhiko Ishiguro', 'S.

We now use this model to interpret the observed modulation of a range of human psychophysical thresholds with and without focal visual attention. Our model - calibrated by an automatic fitting procedure - simultaneously reproduces thresholds for four classical pattern discrimination tasks, performed while attention was engaged by another concurrent task. Our model then predicts that the seemingly complex improvements of certain thresholds, which we observed when attention was fully available for the discrimination tasks, can best be explained by a strengthening of competition among early visual filters.;['7326223', '49965880', '2109463453', '145624227'];['L.

However, most existing methods rely on local contexts to resolve entities independently, which may usually fail due to the data sparsity of local information. To address this issue, we propose a novel neural model for collective entity linking, named as NCEL. NCEL apply Graph Convolutional Network to integrate both local contextual features and global coherence information for entity linking. To improve the computation efficiency, we approximately perform graph convolution on a subgraph of adjacent entity mentions instead of those in the entire text. We further introduce an attention scheme to improve the robustness of NCEL to data noise and train the model on Wikipedia hyperlinks to avoid overfitting and domain bias. In experiments, we evaluate NCEL on five publicly available datasets to verify the linking performance as well;['145014675', '145779862', '8549842', '49293587'];['Yixin Cao', 'Lei Hou', 'Juan-Zi Li', 'Zhiyuan Liu'];f51ff783-cdff-4e22-94fb-28e6336d17b3;International Conference on Computational Linguistics;conference;16;2018.0;Abuja;;;;;['Computer Science'];['36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c']

Because knowledge graphs typically only contain positive facts, sampling useful negative training examples is a nontrivial task. Replacing the head or tail entity of a fact with a uniformly randomly selected entity is a conventional method for generating negative facts, but the majority of the generated negative facts can be easily discriminated from positive facts, and will contribute little towards the training. Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs), we use one knowledge graph embedding model as a negative sample generator to assist the training of our desired model, which acts as the discriminator in GANs. This framework is independent of the concrete form of generator and discriminator, and therefore can utilize a wide variety of knowledge graph embedding models as its building blocks.

2503dff90685857ce7295e37d0045e2eef41c8b8;FastGCN: Fast Learning with Graph Convolutional Networks via Importance Sampling;The graph convolutional networks (GCN) recently proposed by Kipf and Welling are an effective graph model for semi-supervised learning. This model, however, was originally designed to be learned with the presence of both training and test data. Moreover, the recursive neighborhood expansion across layers poses time and memory challenges for training with large, dense graphs. To relax the requirement of simultaneous availability of test data, we interpret graph convolutions as integral transforms of embedding functions under probability measures. Such an interpretation allows for the use of Monte Carlo approaches to consistently estimate the integrals, which in turn leads to a batched training scheme as we propose in this work---FastGCN. Enhanced with importance sampling, FastGCN not only is efficient for training but also generalizes well for inference. We show a comprehensive set of experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness compared with GCN and related models.

If V is the number of vertices in the graph, the algorithm requires time proportional to V log V and space proportional to V when run on a random-access computer. The algorithm constructs the facial boundaries of a planar representation without backup, using extensive list-processing features to speed computation. The theoretical time bound improves on that of previously published algorithms.

0a6a9e6d4e3efd7c69357769305b70097281655f;DropEdge: Towards Deep Graph Convolutional Networks on Node Classification;Over-fitting and over-smoothing are two main obstacles of developing deep Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for node classification. In particular, over-fitting weakens the generalization ability on small dataset, while over-smoothing impedes model training by isolating output representations from the input features with the increase in network depth. This paper proposes DropEdge, a novel and flexible technique to alleviate both issues. At its core, DropEdge randomly removes a certain number of edges from the input graph at each training epoch, acting like a data augmenter and also a message passing reducer. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that DropEdge either retards the convergence speed of over-smoothing or relieves the information loss caused by it. More importantly, our DropEdge is a general skill that can be equipped with many other backbone models (e.g. GCN, ResGCN, GraphSAGE, and JKNet) for enhanced performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks verify that DropEdge consistently improves the performance on a;['48537464', '123175679', '1754673', '1768190'];['Yu Rong', 'Wenbing Huang', 'Tingyang Xu', 'Junzhou Huang'];939c6e1d-0d17-4d6e-8a82-66d960df0e40;International Conference on Learning Representations;conference;8;2019.0;Paris;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['fd075bcdf2d7e13d23f7c249a8eded343d5bbe3b', 'ac225094aab9e7b629bc5b3343e026dea0200c70', '5aea95e1ae78a66474051a330ded374e199b658c', 'd81fc968196e06ccafd7ea4c008b13e1cad1be64', '2503dff90685857ce7295e37d0045e2eef41c8b8', '36652428740cd30d245d55889f01a7fb04a91c93', '51a2bc2e8fb8ed47a085df33dd965e57335080a0', 'c751ab01aedc2888a7fe6e8b4f77ab1afa94072f', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', 'b5007972c6f5a2294f83357c73e12664dd7c85b3', 'f09f7888aa5aeaf88a2a44aea768d9a8747e97d2', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '7c6de5a9e02a779e24504619050c6118f4eac181', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d', '23ffaa0fe06eae05817f527a47ac3291077f9e58', 'fff114cbba4f3ba900f33da574283e3de7f26c83', '81a4fd3004df0eb05d6c1cef96ad33d5407820df']

Our main tool is separation of each pixel p from a special point outside the image by a cut of a minimum cost. Such a cut creates a group of pixels C/sub p/ around each pixel. We show that these groups C/sub p/ are either disjoint or nested in each other and so they give a natural segmentation of the image. In addition this property allows an efficient implementation of the algorithms because for most pixels p the computation of C/sub p/ is not performed on the whole graph. We inspect all C/sub p/ and discard those which are not interesting, for example if they are too small. This procedure automatically groups small components together or merges them into nearby large clusters. Effectively, our segmentation is performed by extracting significant non-intersecting closed contours. We present interesting segmentation results on;['1922280'];['Olga Veksler'];;;;;;;39l6q3kw;Proceedings IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. CVPR 2000 (Cat.

An important task is collective classification, which is to jointly classify networked objects. While it holds a great promise to produce a better accuracy than non-collective classifiers, collective classification is computationally challenging and has not leveraged on the recent breakthroughs of deep learning. We present Column Network (CLN), a novel deep learning model for collective classification in multi-relational domains. CLN has many desirable theoretical properties: (i) it encodes multi-relations between any two instances; (ii) it is deep and compact, allowing complex functions to be approximated at the network level with a small set of free parameters; (iii) local and relational features are learned simultaneously; (iv) long-range, higher-order dependencies between instances are supported naturally; and (v) crucially, learning and inference are efficient with linear complexity in the size of the network and the number of relations.

As the size of graphs reaches several Giga-, Tera- or Peta-bytes, the necessity for such a library grows too. To the best of our knowledge, PEGASUS is the first such library, implemented on the top of the Hadoop platform, the open source version of MapReduce. Many graph mining operations (PageRank, spectral clustering, diameter estimation, connected components etc.) are essentially a repeated matrix-vector multiplication. In this paper we describe a very important primitive for PEGASUS, called GIM-V (Generalized Iterated Matrix-Vector multiplication).

ace1059fd85bbb8b41874a47a029bba7899124a5;Geometric Matrix Completion with Recurrent Multi-Graph Neural Networks;Matrix completion models are among the most common formulations of recommender systems. Recent works have showed a boost of performance of these techniques when introducing the pairwise relationships between users/items in the form of graphs, and imposing smoothness priors on these graphs. However, such techniques do not fully exploit the local stationarity structures of user/item graphs, and the number of parameters to learn is linear w.r.t. the number of users and items. We propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations by using geometric deep learning on graphs. Our matrix completion architecture combines graph convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks to learn meaningful statistical graph-structured patterns and the non-linear diffusion process that generates the known ratings. This neural network system requires a constant number of parameters independent of the matrix size. We apply our method on both synthetic and real datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.;['2500309', '1732570', '2549032'];['Federico Monti', 'M. Bronstein', 'X.

e6ea85add58fb25448042edb9af16f0d955c17da;MGAE: Marginalized Graph Autoencoder for Graph Clustering;Graph clustering aims to discovercommunity structures in networks, the task being fundamentally challenging mainly because the topology structure and the content of the graphs are difficult to represent for clustering analysis. Recently, graph clustering has moved from traditional shallow methods to deep learning approaches, thanks to the unique feature representation learning capability of deep learning. However, existing deep approaches for graph clustering can only exploit the structure information, while ignoring the content information associated with the nodes in a graph. In this paper, we propose a novel marginalized graph autoencoder (MGAE) algorithm for graph clustering. The key innovation of MGAE is that it advances the autoencoder to the graph domain, so graph representation learning can be carried out not only in a purely unsupervised setting by leveraging structure and content information, it can also be stacked in a deep fashion to learn effective representation.

While these methods excel with plentiful training data, they are still far from the human ability to learn concepts from just a few examples by reusing previously learned conceptual knowledge in new contexts. We argue that this gap might come from a fundamental misalignment between human and typical AI representations: while the former are grounded in rich sensorimotor experience, the latter are typically passive and limited to a few modalities such as vision and text. We take a step towards closing this gap by proposing an interactive, behavior-based model that represents concepts using sensorimotor contingencies grounded in an agent's experience.

Further, existing approaches tend to breakdown when the number of these types grows. In this paper, we propose a method for modeling large multi-relational datasets, with possibly thousands of relations. Our model is based on a bilinear structure, which captures various orders of interaction of the data, and also shares sparse latent factors across different relations. We illustrate the performance of our approach on standard tensor-factorization datasets where we attain, or outperform, state-of-the-art results.

However, it is very challenging since the traffic flows usually show high nonlinearities and complex patterns. Most existing traffic flow prediction methods, lacking abilities of modeling the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations of traffic data, thus cannot yield satisfactory prediction results. In this paper, we propose a novel attention based spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ASTGCN) model to solve traffic flow forecasting problem. ASTGCN mainly consists of three independent components to respectively model three temporal properties of traffic flows, i.e., recent, daily-periodic and weekly-periodic dependencies. More specifically, each component contains two major parts: 1) the spatial-temporal attention mechanism to effectively capture the dynamic spatialtemporal correlations in traffic data; 2) the spatial-temporal convolution which simultaneously employs graph convolutions to capture the spatial patterns and common standard convolutions to describe the temporal features.

f0bfcda65e04d481767dba40eade6c7001ee908d;Modeling Complex Spatial Patterns with Temporal Features via Heterogenous Graph Embedding Networks;Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is an important problem in many fields. Accurate forecasting results can effectively help decision-making. Variables in MTS have rich relations among each other and the value of each variable in MTS depends both on its historical values and on other variables. These rich relations can be static and predictable or dynamic and latent. Existing methods do not incorporate these rich relational information into modeling or only model certain relation among MTS variables. To jointly model rich relations among variables and temporal dependencies within the time series, a novel end-to-end deep learning model, termed Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Heterogenous Graph Neural Networks (MTHetGNN) is proposed in this paper. To characterize rich relations among variables, a relation embedding module is introduced in our model, where each variable is regarded as a graph node and each type of edge represents a specific relationship among variables or one;['150348683', '1563776408', '13604375', '2060732447', '2109020226', '2108157558'];['Yida Huang', 'Haoyan Xu', 'Ziheng Duan', 'Anni Ren', 'Jie Feng', 'Xiaoqian Wang'];;;;;;;ckdadyfj;ArXiv;2020.0;abs/2008.08617;['Graph', 'Computer Science'];['00b7efbf14a54cced4b9f19e663b70ffbd01324b', '204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776', 'cd8a9914d50b0ac63315872530274d158d6aff09', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '36ee2c8bd605afd48035d15fdc6b8c8842363376', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8', 'fff114cbba4f3ba900f33da574283e3de7f26c83', 'f6b51c8753a871dc94ff32152c00c01e94f90f09']

However, as most network analysis methods are built on a complete network structure, the natural questions to ask are: (a) how well these methods perform with incomplete network structure, (b) which structural observation and network analysis method to choose for a specific task, and (c) is it beneficial to complete the missing structure. Methods In this paper, we consider the incomplete network structure as one random sampling instance from a complete graph, and we choose graph neural networks (GNNs), which have achieved promising results on various graph learning tasks, as the representative of network analysis methods. To identify the robustness of GNNs under graph sampling scenarios, we systemically evaluated six state-of-the-art GNNs under four commonly used graph sampling methods.

Most approaches on graph embedding focus on preserving the graph structure or minimizing the reconstruction errors for graph data. They have mostly overlooked the embedding distribution of the latent codes, which unfortunately may lead to inferior representation in many cases. In this article, we present a novel adversarially regularized framework for graph embedding. By employing the graph convolutional network as an encoder, our framework embeds the topological information and node content into a vector representation, from which a graph decoder is further built to reconstruct the input graph. The adversarial training principle is applied to enforce our latent codes to match a prior Gaussian or uniform distribution. Based on this framework, we derive two variants of the adversarial models, the adversarially regularized graph autoencoder (ARGA) and its variational version, and;['2585415', '2707570', '35148540', '2062835', '1746594', '48934799'];['Shirui Pan', 'Ruiqi Hu', 'S.

Despite its simplicity, this assumption proves to be powerful since extensive experiments show that TransE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction on two knowledge bases.

Our main contribution is a novel convolution operator based on B-splines, that makes the computation time independent from the kernel size due to the local support property of the B-spline basis functions. As a result, we obtain a generalization of the traditional CNN convolution operator by using continuous kernel functions parametrized by a fixed number of trainable weights. In contrast to related approaches that filter in the spectral domain, the proposed method aggregates features purely in the spatial domain. In addition, SplineCNN allows entire end-to-end training of deep architectures, using only the geometric structure as input, instead of handcrafted feature descriptors.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.

The core of the proposed framework is a neural network model, also called HIN2Vec, designed to capture the rich semantics embedded in HINs by exploiting different types of relationships among nodes. Given a set of relationships specified in forms of meta-paths in an HIN, HIN2Vec carries out multiple prediction training tasks jointly based on a target set of relationships to learn latent vectors of nodes and meta-paths in the HIN. In addition to model design, several issues unique to HIN2Vec, including regularization of meta-path vectors, node type selection in negative sampling, and cycles in random walks, are examined. To validate our ideas, we learn latent vectors of nodes using four large-scale real HIN datasets, including Blogcatalog, Yelp, DBLP and U.S. Patents, and use them as features for multi-label node classification and link prediction;['2436782', '1686360', '98899797'];['Tao-Yang Fu', 'Wang-Chien Lee', 'Zhen Lei'];7431ff67-91dc-41fa-b322-1b1ca657025f;International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management;conference;2;2017.0;São Paulo;;;;;['Computer Science'];['36ee2c8bd605afd48035d15fdc6b8c8842363376', '0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8', 'fff114cbba4f3ba900f33da574283e3de7f26c83', '87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f']

In this work, we study the task of logical generalization using GNNs by designing a benchmark suite grounded in first-order logic. Our benchmark suite, GraphLog, requires that learning algorithms perform rule induction in different synthetic logics, represented as knowledge graphs. GraphLog consists of relation prediction tasks on 57 distinct logical domains. We use GraphLog to evaluate GNNs in three different setups: single-task supervised learning, multi-task pretraining, and continual learning.

67ab606526f914d474b88ffb9c95a28de38aab52;Predicting human resting-state functional connectivity from structural connectivity;In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of neuronal populations are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks—including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time—can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of;['1890761', '1694232', '2769049', '2292823', '2226783828', '144728460', '1896450', '1896450'];['C.

Given a dataset containing graphs in the form of (G,y) where G is a graph and y is its class, we aim to develop neural networks that read the graphs directly and learn a classification function. There are two main challenges: 1) how to extract useful features characterizing the rich information encoded in a graph for classification purpose, and 2) how to sequentially read a graph in a meaningful and consistent order. To address the first challenge, we design a localized graph convolution model and show its connection with two graph kernels. To address the second challenge, we design a novel SortPooling layer which sorts graph vertices in a consistent order so that traditional neural networks can be trained on the graphs.

However, GCN computes nodes' representation recursively from their neighbors, making the receptive field size grow exponentially with the number of layers. Previous attempts on reducing the receptive field size by subsampling neighbors do not have any convergence guarantee, and their receptive field size per node is still in the order of hundreds. In this paper, we develop a preprocessing strategy and two control variate based algorithms to further reduce the receptive field size. Our algorithms are guaranteed to converge to GCN's local optimum regardless of the neighbor sampling size. Empirical results show that our algorithms have a similar convergence speed per epoch with the exact algorithm even using only two neighbors per node. The time consumption of our algorithm on the Reddit dataset is only one fifth of previous neighbor sampling algorithms.;['2276707', '145254043'];['Jianfei Chen', 'Jun Zhu'];;;;;;;96c5nz42;ArXiv;2017.0;abs/1710.10568;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['ecf6c42d84351f34e1625a6a2e4cc6526da45c74', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', 'cd8a9914d50b0ac63315872530274d158d6aff09', '54906484f42e871f7c47bbfe784a358b1448231f', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '36ee2c8bd605afd48035d15fdc6b8c8842363376', '0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8', 'a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8', 'fff114cbba4f3ba900f33da574283e3de7f26c83']
ca064483ce24c92b738a16a33d4eeb4541bdd9f6;Interpretable Fashion Matching with Rich Attributes;Understanding the mix-and-match relationships of fashion items receives increasing attention in fashion industry. Existing methods have primarily utilized the visual content to learn the visual compatibility and performed matching in a latent space. Despite their effectiveness, these methods work like a black box and cannot reveal the reasons that two items match well. The rich attributes associated with fashion items, e.g.,off-shoulder dress and black skinny jean, which describe the semantics of items in a human-interpretable way, have largely been ignored. This work tackles the interpretable fashion matching task, aiming to inject interpretability into the compatibility modeling of items. Specifically, given a corpus of matched pairs of items, we not only can predict the compatibility score of unseen pairs, but also learn the interpretable patterns that lead to a good match, e.g., white T-shirt matches with black trouser.

acc43abe319bca7652a91f7d4ca6187049fb82e4;Measuring abstract reasoning in neural networks;Whether neural networks can learn abstract reasoning or whether they merely rely on superficial statistics is a topic of recent debate. Here, we propose a dataset and challenge designed to probe abstract reasoning, inspired by a well-known human IQ test. To succeed at this challenge, models must cope with various generalisation `regimes' in which the training and test data differ in clearly-defined ways. We show that popular models such as ResNets perform poorly, even when the training and test sets differ only minimally, and we present a novel architecture, with a structure designed to encourage reasoning, that does significantly better. When we vary the way in which the test questions and training data differ, we find that our model is notably proficient at certain forms of generalisation, but notably weak at others. We further show that the model's ability to generalise improves markedly if it is trained to predict symbolic;['35030998', '145783676', '50181861', '4690624', '2542999'];['Adam Santoro', 'Felix Hill', 'D.

We then use the induced interlingual word representation as augmenting features to train a delexicalized dependency parser on labeled sentences in the source language and apply it to the target sentences. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, extensive experiments are conducted on cross-lingual dependency parsing tasks with nine different languages.

Due to their massive success, GNNs have attracted a lot of attention, and many novel architectures have been put forward. In this paper we show that existing evaluation strategies for GNN models have serious shortcomings. We show that using the same train/validation/test splits of the same datasets, as well as making significant changes to the training procedure (e.g. early stopping criteria) precludes a fair comparison of different architectures. We perform a thorough empirical evaluation of four prominent GNN models and show that considering different splits of the data leads to dramatically different rankings of models. Even more importantly, our findings suggest that simpler GNN architectures are able to outperform the more sophisticated ones if the hyperparameters and the training procedure are tuned fairly;['32724677', '51896688', '11754930', '3075189'];['Oleksandr Shchur', 'Maximilian Mumme', 'Aleksandar Bojchevski', 'Stephan Günnemann'];;;;;;;bcwv22ho;ArXiv;2018.0;abs/1811.05868;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['ac225094aab9e7b629bc5b3343e026dea0200c70', '6c44f8e62d824bcda4f291c679a5518bbd4225f6', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', 'f09f7888aa5aeaf88a2a44aea768d9a8747e97d2', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '3d846cb01f6a975554035d2210b578ca61344b22', 'a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8', 'ea9d2a2b4ce11aaf85136840c65f3bc9c03ab649']

We propose KBLSTM, a novel neural model that leverages continuous representations of KBs to enhance the learning of recurrent neural networks for machine reading. To effectively integrate background knowledge with information from the currently processed text, our model employs an attention mechanism with a sentinel to adaptively decide whether to attend to background knowledge and which information from KBs is useful.

This first comprehensive overview of SSL presents state-of-the-art algorithms, a taxonomy of the field, selected applications, benchmark experiments, and perspectives on ongoing and future research. Semi-Supervised Learning first presents the key assumptions and ideas underlying the field: smoothness, cluster or low-density separation, manifold structure, and transduction. The core of the book is the presentation of SSL methods, organized according to algorithmic strategies.

Our model is based on scoring functions that operate by learning low-dimensional embeddings of words, entities and relationships from a knowledge base. We empirically show on New York Times articles aligned with Freebase relations that our approach is able to efficiently use the extra information provided by a large subset of Freebase data (4M entities, 23k relationships) to improve over methods that rely on text features alone.;['145183709', '1713934', '2406794', '1746841'];['J.

In this work, we propose holographic embeddings (HolE) to learn compositional vector space representations of entire knowledge graphs. The proposed method is related to holographic models of associative memory in that it employs circular correlation to create compositional representations. By using correlation as the compositional operator, HolE can capture rich interactions but simultaneously remains efficient to compute, easy to train, and scalable to very large datasets. Experimentally, we show that holographic embeddings are able to outperform state-of-the-art methods for link prediction on knowledge graphs and relational learning benchmark datasets.;['1729762', '1690976', '1685292'];['Maximilian Nickel', 'L.

While translation equivariance provides a powerful inductive bias for images, we often additionally desire equivariance to other transformations, such as rotations, especially for non-image data. We propose a general method to construct a convolutional layer that is equivariant to transformations from any specified Lie group with a surjective exponential map. Incorporating equivariance to a new group requires implementing only the group exponential and logarithm maps, enabling rapid prototyping. Showcasing the simplicity and generality of our method, we apply the same model architecture to images, ball-and-stick molecular data, and Hamiltonian dynamical systems. For Hamiltonian systems, the equivariance of our models is especially impactful, leading to exact conservation of linear and angular momentum.;['51007156', '2067201658', '7991830', '145771261'];['Marc Finzi', 'S.

However, current dynamic graph learning methods lack a principled way in modeling temporal, multi-relational, and concurrent interactions between nodes---a limitation that is especially problematic for the task of temporal knowledge graph reasoning, where the goal is to predict unseen entity relationships (i.e., events) over time. Here we present Recurrent Event Network (RE-Net)---a novel neural architecture for modeling complex event sequences---which consists of a recurrent event encoder and a neighborhood aggregator. The event encoder employs an RNN to capture (subject, relation) or (object, relation)-specific patterns from historical, multi-relational interactions between entities. The neighborhood aggregator summarizes concurrent, multi-hop entity interactions within each time stamp. An output layer is designed for predicting forthcoming events. Extensive experiments on temporal link prediction over four public TKG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and strength of RE-Net, especially on multi-step;['8844876', '2115692939', '144171096', '145201124'];['Woojeong Jin', 'Changlin Zhang', 'Pedro A.

We first provide insights on working principles of adversarial learning over graphs and then present GraphSGAN, a novel approach to semi-supervised learning on graphs. In GraphSGAN, generator and classifier networks play a novel competitive game. At equilibrium, generator generates fake samples in low-density areas between subgraphs. In order to discriminate fake samples from the real, classifier implicitly takes the density property of subgraph into consideration. An efficient adversarial learning algorithm has been developed to improve traditional normalized graph Laplacian regularization with a theoretical guarantee. Experimental results on several different genres of datasets show that the proposed GraphSGAN significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

A key challenge is to find formal descriptions of the data structures that are instantiated, which are used as input to a proof procedure that verifies the program. Standard approaches to the problem are to severely restrict the space of data structures that can be recognized (e.g., just lists), or to use search guided by handspecified heuristics. In this work, we explore a machine learning-based approach, where we execute the program and then learn to map the state of heap memory (represented as a labelled directed graph) to a logical description of the instantiated data structures. We formulate the learning problem as one of mapping from graphs to an element of a grammar over data structure descriptions. We report preliminary empirical results showing this to be a promising new direction. 1.;['2107692', '50580847', '145761556', '143967473', '1725299'];['Marc Brockschmidt', 'Yuxin Chen', 'B.

The knowledge extracted by these AI agents is organized into a heterogeneous graph, called Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), where the nodes and the edges represent the entities engaging in scholarly communications and the relationships among them, respectively. The frequently updated data set and a few software tools central to the underlying AI components are distributed under an open data license for research and commercial applications. This paper describes the design, schema, and technical and business motivations behind MAG and elaborates how MAG can be used in analytics, search, and recommendation scenarios.

While our implementation only guarantees average-case efficiency, i.e., assuming randomly chosen edge-weights, it turns out that its performance on real-world instances with non-random edge weights is actually even better than on the respective inputs with random weights. Furthermore, compared to the currently best implementation for external-memory BFS [6], which in a sense constitutes a lower bound for SSSP, the running time of our approach always stayed within a factor of five, for the most difficult graph classes the difference was even less than a factor of two.

These neural networks are constructed recursively by taking inspiration from the backward chaining algorithm as used in Prolog. Specifically, we replace symbolic unification with a differentiable computation on vector representations of symbols using a radial basis function kernel, thereby combining symbolic reasoning with learning subsymbolic vector representations. By using gradient descent, the resulting neural network can be trained to infer facts from a given incomplete knowledge base. It learns to (i) place representations of similar symbols in close proximity in a vector space, (ii) make use of such similarities to prove queries, (iii) induce logical rules, and (iv) use provided and induced logical rules for multi-hop reasoning.

Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model.

c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c;Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering;In this work, we are interested in generalizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from low-dimensional regular grids, where image, video and speech are represented, to high-dimensional irregular domains, such as social networks, brain connectomes or words' embedding, represented by graphs. We present a formulation of CNNs in the context of spectral graph theory, which provides the necessary mathematical background and efficient numerical schemes to design fast localized convolutional filters on graphs. Importantly, the proposed technique offers the same linear computational complexity and constant learning complexity as classical CNNs, while being universal to any graph structure. Experiments on MNIST and 20NEWS demonstrate the ability of this novel deep learning system to learn local, stationary, and compositional features on graphs.;['3422350', '2549032', '1697397'];['Michaël Defferrard', 'X.

An active line of research in this area is concerned with classification when one has information about pairwise relationships among the objects to be classified; this issue is one of the principal motivations for the framework of Markov random fields, and it arises in areas such as image processing, biometry: and document analysis. In its most basic form, this style of analysis seeks a classification that optimizes a combinatorial function consisting of assignment costs-based on the individual choice of label we make for each object-and separation costs-based on the pair of choices we make for two ""related"" objects. We formulate a general classification problem of this type, the metric labeling problem; we show that";['3371403', '1746222'];['J. Kleinberg', 'É.

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning;['1954250', '1702139'];['Aditya Grover', 'J.

However, this introduces a challenging learning scenario where the relation expressed by a pair of entities found in a sentence is unknown. For example, a sentence containing Balzac and France may express BornIn or Died, an unknown relation, or no relation at all. Because of this, traditional supervised learning, which assumes that each example is explicitly mapped to a label, is not appropriate. We propose a novel approach to multi-instance multi-label learning for RE, which jointly models all the instances of a pair of entities in text and all their labels using a graphical model with latent variables. Our model performs competitively on two difficult domains.;['1760868', '2099589', '1701451', '144783904'];['M. Surdeanu', 'J. Tibshirani', 'Ramesh Nallapati', 'Christopher D.

Previously, most works focused on symbolic representation of knowledge graph with structure information, which can not handle new entities or entities with few facts well. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture to utilize both structural and textual information of entities. Specifically, we introduce three neural models to encode the valuable information from text description of entity, among which an attentive model can select related information as needed. Then, a gating mechanism is applied to integrate representations of structure and text into a unified architecture.

However, the success of most current models is the result of heavy training on big data. Meta-learning addresses this problem by extracting common knowledge across different tasks that can be quickly adapted to new tasks. However, they do not fully explore weakly-supervised information, which is usually free or cheap to collect. In this paper, we show that weakly-labeled data can significantly improve the performance of meta-learning on few-shot classification. We propose prototype propagation network (PPN) trained on few-shot tasks together with data annotated by coarse-label. Given a category graph of the targeted fine-classes and some weakly-labeled coarse-classes, PPN learns an attention mechanism which propagates the prototype of one class to another on the graph, so that the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier defined on the propagated prototypes results in high accuracy across different;['49480497', '1805655', '2062835', '1746594', '2082966', '48934799'];['Lu Liu', 'Tianyi Zhou', 'Guodong Long', 'Jing Jiang', 'Lina Yao', 'Chengqi Zhang'];67f7f831-711a-43c8-8785-1e09005359b5;International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence;conference;6;2019.0;São Paulo;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['e6ea85add58fb25448042edb9af16f0d955c17da', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', '815c84ab906e43f3e6322f2ca3fd5e1360c64285', 'a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8', '81a4fd3004df0eb05d6c1cef96ad33d5407820df']

Here we present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood.

ac2e6afbadc3428eb5dff167b52025e64525441e;When Does Self-Supervision Help Graph Convolutional Networks?;Self-supervision as an emerging technique has been employed to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for more transferrable, generalizable, and robust representation learning of images. Its introduction to graph convolutional networks (GCNs) operating on graph data is however rarely explored. In this study, we report the first systematic exploration and assessment of incorporating self-supervision into GCNs. We first elaborate three mechanisms to incorporate self-supervision into GCNs, analyze the limitations of pretraining & finetuning and self-training, and proceed to focus on multi-task learning. Moreover, we propose to investigate three novel self-supervised learning tasks for GCNs with theoretical rationales and numerical comparisons. Lastly, we further integrate multi-task self-supervision into graph adversarial training. Our results show that, with properly designed task forms and incorporation mechanisms, self-supervision benefits GCNs in gaining more generalizability and robustness.

e9d7f589a3d368a3701832e28d90ca09ec9e5577;Segmentation using eigenvectors: a unifying view;Automatic grouping and segmentation of images remains a challenging problem in computer vision. Recently, a number of authors have demonstrated good performance on this task using methods that are based on eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. These approaches are extremely attractive in that they are based on simple eigendecomposition algorithms whose stability is well understood. Nevertheless, the use of eigendecompositions in the context of segmentation is far from well understood. In this paper we give a unified treatment of these algorithms, and show the close connections between them while highlighting their distinguishing features. We then prove results on eigenvectors of block matrices that allow us to analyze the performance of these algorithms in simple grouping settings. Finally, we use our analysis to motivate a variation on the existing methods that combines aspects from different eigenvector segmentation algorithms. We illustrate our analysis with results on real and synthetic images.;['30400079'];['Yair Weiss'];;;;;;;meixw40w;Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision;1999.0;2;['Computer Science'];['23d31d6c75a3c62ee2cedd22308c5c0ba34217e7', 'b94c7ff9532ab26c3aedbee3988ec4c7a237c173']

75d6b55e8b9146e3d9dce9091cfb03211a664b3a;MMGCN: Multi-modal Graph Convolution Network for Personalized Recommendation of Micro-video;Personalized recommendation plays a central role in many online content sharing platforms. To provide quality micro-video recommendation service, it is of crucial importance to consider the interactions between users and items (i.e. micro-videos) as well as the item contents from various modalities (e.g. visual, acoustic, and textual). Existing works on multimedia recommendation largely exploit multi-modal contents to enrich item representations, while less effort is made to leverage information interchange between users and items to enhance user representations and further capture user's fine-grained preferences on different modalities. In this paper, we propose to exploit user-item interactions to guide the representation learning in each modality, and further personalized micro-video recommendation. We design a Multi-modal Graph Convolution Network (MMGCN) framework built upon the message-passing idea of graph neural networks, which can yield modal-specific representations of users and micro-videos to better capture user preferences. Specifically, we construct a user-item bipartite graph in each modality,;['1887997', '98285513', '143982887', '7792071', '48043335', '144078686'];['Yin-wei Wei', 'Xiang Wang', 'Liqiang Nie', 'Xiangnan He', 'Richang Hong', 'Tat-Seng Chua'];f2c85de5-7cfa-4b92-8714-a0fbdcf0274e;ACM Multimedia;conference;12;2019.0;Houston;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science'];['c5f5f179d80a3bf9b4f29750283a87eaca42e91b', 'de02ec03f6a71246e505862a7195894601fbab99', '2335a95bfed617953675b5227cc881707746f53b', '6c96c2d4a3fbd572fef2d59cb856521ee1746789', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', 'ace1059fd85bbb8b41874a47a029bba7899124a5', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '7c6de5a9e02a779e24504619050c6118f4eac181', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d']

The algorithm consists of a sampling framework which unifies the processes of model selection, parameter estimation and image segmentation, in a single Markov chain. To achieve this, reversible jumps are incorporated into the Markov chain to allow movement between model spaces. By using partial decoupling to segment the MRF it is possible to generate jump proposals efficiently while providing a mechanism for the use of deterministic methods, such as Gabor filtering, to speed up convergence.;['31705094', '145793875'];['Simon A.

f37e1b62a767a307c046404ca96bc140b3e68cb5;GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation;Recent methods for learning vector space representations of words have succeeded in capturing fine-grained semantic and syntactic regularities using vector arithmetic, but the origin of these regularities has remained opaque. We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.;['143845796', '2166511', '144783904'];['Jeffrey Pennington', 'R. Socher', 'Christopher D.

We investigate empirically to what extent pure bottom-up attention can extract useful information about the location, size and shape of objects from images and demonstrate how this information can be utilized to enable unsupervised learning of objects from unlabeled images. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach to using bottom-up attention is indeed useful for a variety of applications.;['48774107', '40638490', '145624227', '1690922'];['Ueli Rutishauser', 'Dirk B.

cd89cc9a83ac2dd0639d7b452de1f9540271f274;Relational Collaborative Filtering: Modeling Multiple Item Relations for Recommendation;Existing item-based collaborative filtering (ICF) methods leverage only the relation of collaborative similarity - i.e., the item similarity evidenced by user interactions like ratings and purchases. Nevertheless, there exist multiple relations between items in real-world scenarios, e.g., two movies share the same director, two products complement with each other, etc. Distinct from the collaborative similarity that implies co-interact patterns from the user's perspective, these relations reveal fine-grained knowledge on items from different perspectives of meta-data, functionality, etc. However, how to incorporate multiple item relations is less explored in recommendation research. In this work, we propose Relational Collaborative Filtering (RCF) to exploit multiple item relations in recommender systems. We find that both the relation type (e.g., shared director) and the relation value (e.g., Steven Spielberg) are crucial in inferring user preference. To this end, we develop a two-level hierarchical attention mechanism to model user preference - the first-level attention discriminates which;['143625677', '7792071', '1739818', '1699819', '50686770'];['Xin Xin', 'Xiangnan He', 'Yongfeng Zhang', 'Yongdong Zhang', 'J.

1546b92b145220240e802358c0d94ce621370128;SSE: Semantically Smooth Embedding for Knowledge Graphs;This paper considers the problem of embedding Knowledge Graphs (KGs) consisting of entities and relations into low-dimensional vector spaces. Most of the existing methods perform this task based solely on observed facts. The only requirement is that the learned embeddings should be compatible within each individual fact. In this paper, aiming at further discovering the intrinsic geometric structure of the embedding space, we propose Semantically Smooth Embedding (SSE). The key idea of SSE is to take full advantage of additional semantic information and enforce the embedding space to be semantically smooth, i.e., entities belonging to the same semantic category will lie close to each other in the embedding space. Two manifold learning algorithms Laplacian Eigenmaps and Locally Linear Embedding are used to model the smoothness assumption. Both are formulated as geometrically based regularization terms to constrain the embedding task.

Noise contrastive estimation (NCE) for word embeddings and translating embeddings for knowledge graphs are examples in NLP employing this approach. In this work, we view contrastive learning as an abstraction of all such methods and augment the negative sampler into a mixture distribution containing an adversarially learned sampler.

e1cef464322243feb12ac3f81873c912e071a1a6;GraphRNN: Generating Realistic Graphs with Deep Auto-regressive Models;Modeling and generating graphs is fundamental for studying networks in biology, engineering, and social sciences. However, modeling complex distributions over graphs and then efficiently sampling from these distributions is challenging due to the non-unique, high-dimensional nature of graphs and the complex, non-local dependencies that exist between edges in a given graph. Here we propose GraphRNN, a deep autoregressive model that addresses the above challenges and approximates any distribution of graphs with minimal assumptions about their structure. GraphRNN learns to generate graphs by training on a representative set of graphs and decomposes the graph generation process into a sequence of node and edge formations, conditioned on the graph structure generated so far. In order to quantitatively evaluate the performance of GraphRNN, we introduce a benchmark suite of datasets, baselines and novel evaluation metrics based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy, which measure distances between sets of graphs. Our experiments show that GraphRNN significantly;['145829303', '83539859', '145201124', '49437682', '1702139'];['Jiaxuan You', 'Rex Ying', 'Xiang Ren', 'William L. Hamilton', 'J.

Our approach, which we call Janossy pooling, expresses a permutation-invariant function as the average of a permutation-sensitive function applied to all reorderings of the input sequence. This allows us to leverage the rich and mature literature on permutation-sensitive functions to construct novel and flexible permutation-invariant functions. If carried out naively, Janossy pooling can be computationally prohibitive. To allow computational tractability, we consider three kinds of approximations: canonical orderings of sequences, functions with $k$-order interactions, and stochastic optimization algorithms with random permutations. Our framework unifies a variety of existing work in the literature, and suggests possible modeling and algorithmic extensions. We explore a few in our experiments, which demonstrate improved performance over current state-of-the-art methods.;['49433805', '2057595515', '144208693', '145617731'];['R.

Traffic forecasting is one canonical example of such learning task. The task is challenging due to (1) complex spatial dependency on road networks, (2) non-linear temporal dynamics with changing road conditions and (3) inherent difficulty of long-term forecasting. To address these challenges, we propose to model the traffic flow as a diffusion process on a directed graph and introduce Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN), a deep learning framework for traffic forecasting that incorporates both spatial and temporal dependency in the traffic flow. Specifically, DCRNN captures the spatial dependency using bidirectional random walks on the graph, and the temporal dependency using the encoder-decoder architecture with scheduled sampling. We evaluate the framework on two real-world large scale road network traffic datasets and observe consistent improvement of 12% - 15% over state-of-the-art baselines.;['1720837956', '2023052', '1773086', '47909587'];['Yaguang Li', 'Rose Yu', 'C.

0ca7d8c3250d43d14fdde46bf6fc299654d861ef;Heterogeneous Graph Transformer;Recent years have witnessed the emerging success of graph neural networks (GNNs) for modeling structured data. However, most GNNs are designed for homogeneous graphs, in which all nodes and edges belong to the same types, making it infeasible to represent heterogeneous structures. In this paper, we present the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) architecture for modeling Web-scale heterogeneous graphs. To model heterogeneity, we design node- and edge-type dependent parameters to characterize the heterogeneous attention over each edge, empowering HGT to maintain dedicated representations for different types of nodes and edges. To handle Web-scale graph data, we design the heterogeneous mini-batch graph sampling algorithm—HGSampling—for efficient and scalable training. Extensive experiments on the Open Academic Graph of 179 million nodes and 2 billion edges show that the proposed HGT model consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art GNN baselines by 9–21 on various downstream tasks. The dataset and source code of HGT are publicly available;['3407296', '2047998', '1748169', '2109461904'];['Ziniu Hu', 'Yuxiao Dong', 'Kuansan Wang', 'Yizhou Sun'];e07422f9-c065-40c3-a37b-75e98dce79fe;The Web Conference;conference;4;2020.0;Tokyo;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['e0c6abdbdecf04ffac65c440da77fb9d66bb474c', '00b7efbf14a54cced4b9f19e663b70ffbd01324b', '63a513832f56addb67be81a2fa399b233f3030fc', '2503dff90685857ce7295e37d0045e2eef41c8b8', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', 'cd8a9914d50b0ac63315872530274d158d6aff09', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d']

They need to compute node representations recursively from their neighbors. Current GCN training algorithms suffer from either high computational costs that grow exponentially with the number of layers, or high memory usage for loading the entire graph and node embeddings. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient layer-wise training framework for GCN (L-GCN), that disentangles feature aggregation and feature transformation during training, hence greatly reducing time and memory complexities. We present theoretical analysis for L-GCN under the graph isomorphism framework, that L-GCN leads to as powerful GCNs as the more costly conventional training algorithm does, under mild conditions. We further propose L^2-GCN, which learns a controller for each layer that can automatically adjust the training epochs per layer in L-GCN.

fcd24f925ee7f110bf63947f871367aabcc5fdc9;Towards Sparse Hierarchical Graph Classifiers;Recent advances in representation learning on graphs, mainly leveraging graph convolutional networks, have brought a substantial improvement on many graph-based benchmark tasks. While novel approaches to learning node embeddings are highly suitable for node classification and link prediction, their application to graph classification (predicting a single label for the entire graph) remains mostly rudimentary, typically using a single global pooling step to aggregate node features or a hand-designed, fixed heuristic for hierarchical coarsening of the graph structure. An important step towards ameliorating this is differentiable graph coarsening---the ability to reduce the size of the graph in an adaptive, data-dependent manner within a graph neural network pipeline, analogous to image downsampling within CNNs. However, the previous prominent approach to pooling has quadratic memory requirements during training and is therefore not scalable to large graphs.

a1d70956de04935a0cc8f3b2f5b04bffabace669;Hierarchical functional modularity in the resting‐state human brain;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that anatomically distinct brain regions are functionally connected during the resting state. Basic topological properties in the brain functional connectivity (BFC) map have highlighted the BFC's small‐world topology. Modularity, a more advanced topological property, has been hypothesized to be evolutionary advantageous, contributing to adaptive aspects of anatomical and functional brain connectivity. However, current definitions of modularity for complex networks focus on nonoverlapping clusters, and are seriously limited by disregarding inclusive relationships. Therefore, BFC's modularity has been mainly qualitatively investigated. Here, we introduce a new definition of modularity, based on a recently improved clustering measurement, which overcomes limitations of previous definitions, and apply it to the study of BFC in resting state fMRI of 53 healthy subjects. Results show hierarchical functional modularity in the brain.

By constructing a user’s profile with the items that the user has consumed, ICF recommends items that are similar to the user’s profile. With the prevalence of machine learning in recent years, significant processes have been made for ICF by learning item similarity (or representation) from data. Nevertheless, we argue that most existing works have only considered linear and shallow relationships between items, which are insufficient to capture the complicated decision-making process of users. In this article, we propose a more expressive ICF solution by accounting for the nonlinear and higher-order relationships among items. Going beyond modeling only the second-order interaction (e.g., similarity) between two items, we additionally consider the interaction among all interacted item pairs by using nonlinear neural networks. By doing this,;['2118670622', '7792071', '2144796537', '2110512672', '49599759', '48043335'];['Feng Xue', 'Xiangnan He', 'Xiang Wang', 'Jiandong Xu', 'Kai Liu', 'Richang Hong'];;;;;;;omlienww;ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS);2018.0;37;['Computer Science'];['833a6052983fa55181b92516d0e1097d74585c58']

By exploiting fundamental spatial properties of images and videos, the CNN always achieves dominant performance on visual tasks. And the Recurrent Networks (RNN) especially long short-term memory methods (LSTM) can successfully characterize the temporal correlation, thus exhibits superior capability for time series tasks. Traffic flow data have plentiful characteristics on both time and space domain. However, applications of CNN and LSTM approaches on traffic flow are limited. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture combined CNN and LSTM to forecast future traffic flow (CLTFP). An 1-dimension CNN is exploited to capture spatial features of traffic flow, and two LSTMs are utilized to mine the short-term variability and periodicities of traffic flow. Given those meaningful features, the feature-level fusion is performed to achieve short-term forecasting.;['1641939256', '1849628'];['Yuankai Wu', 'Huachun Tan'];;;;;;;kx1zfdvo;ArXiv;2016.0;abs/1612.01022;['Deep Learning', 'Computer Science'];['c9538e13bd2a0e33948feb1fce2c56c0bc0eb5d9', '94deb62af3054c49e7d80bd7eb3ed5efe990fc0b', 'a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8', 'c663bbbefed5d9a89ef8d66e56f32576cee37fe6']
c4fd9c86b2b41df51a6fe212406dda81b1997fd4;Linguistic Regularities in Continuous Space Word Representations;Continuous space language models have recently demonstrated outstanding results across a variety of tasks. In this paper, we examine the vector-space word representations that are implicitly learned by the input-layer weights. We find that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by a relation-specific vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on the offsets between words. For example, the male/female relationship is automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, “King Man + Woman” results in a vector very close to “Queen.” We demonstrate that the word vectors capture syntactic regularities by means of syntactic analogy questions (provided with this paper), and are able to correctly answer almost 40% of the questions. We demonstrate that the word vectors capture semantic regularities by using the vector offset method to answer SemEval-2012 Task 2 questions.

e4715a13f6364b1c81e64f247651c3d9e80b6808;Link Prediction Based on Graph Neural Networks;Link prediction is a key problem for network-structured data. Link prediction heuristics use some score functions, such as common neighbors and Katz index, to measure the likelihood of links. They have obtained wide practical uses due to their simplicity, interpretability, and for some of them, scalability. However, every heuristic has a strong assumption on when two nodes are likely to link, which limits their effectiveness on networks where these assumptions fail. In this regard, a more reasonable way should be learning a suitable heuristic from a given network instead of using predefined ones. By extracting a local subgraph around each target link, we aim to learn a function mapping the subgraph patterns to link existence, thus automatically learning a `heuristic' that suits the current network. In this paper, we study this heuristic learning paradigm for link prediction. First, we develop a novel $\gamma$-decaying heuristic theory.

fff114cbba4f3ba900f33da574283e3de7f26c83;DeepWalk: online learning of social representations;We present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse.

a18ad95991db3f735d105ccc5caa246cd6b37d1b;Rabbit Order: Just-in-Time Parallel Reordering for Fast Graph Analysis;Ahead-of-time data layout optimization by vertex reordering is a widely used technique to improve memory access locality in graph analysis. While reordered graphs yield better analysis performance, the existing reordering algorithms use significant amounts of computation time to provide efficient vertex ordering, hence, they fail to reduce end-to-end processing time. This paper presents a first algorithm for just-in-time parallel reordering, named Rabbit Order. It reduces end-to-end runtime by achieving high locality and fast reordering at the same time through two approaches. The first approach is hierarchical community-based ordering, which exploits the locality derived from hierarchical community structures in real-world graphs. Our ordering fully leverages low-latency cache levels by mapping hierarchical communities into hierarchical caches. The second approach is parallel incremental aggregation, which improves the runtime efficiency of reordering by decreasing the number of vertices to be processed. In addition, this approach utilizes lightweight atomic operations for concurrency control to avoid;['1490937630', '38738753', '2222427', '48075831', '3382187'];['Junya Arai', 'Hiroaki Shiokawa', 'T.

With the increasing popularity of taxi requesting services such as Uber and Didi Chuxing (in China), we are able to collect large-scale taxi demand data continuously. How to utilize such big data to improve the demand prediction is an interesting and critical real-world problem.

However, a major consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug interactions, in which activity of one drug may change, favorably or unfavorably, if taken with another drug. The knowledge of drug interactions is often limited because these complex relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality and morbidity. Results: Here, we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions, drug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different type.

However, larger networks and larger datasets result in longer training times that impede research and development progress. Distributed synchronous SGD offers a potential solution to this problem by dividing SGD minibatches over a pool of parallel workers. Yet to make this scheme efficient, the per-worker workload must be large, which implies nontrivial growth in the SGD minibatch size. In this paper, we empirically show that on the ImageNet dataset large minibatches cause optimization difficulties, but when these are addressed the trained networks exhibit good generalization. Specifically, we show no loss of accuracy when training with large minibatch sizes up to 8192 images. To achieve this result, we adopt a hyper-parameter-free linear scaling rule for adjusting learning rates as a function of minibatch size and develop a new warmup scheme that overcomes optimization challenges early in training. With these simple techniques,;['47316088', '3127283', '2983898', '34837514', '2065373815', '1717990', '3609856', '39978391', '39353098'];['Priya Goyal', 'Piotr Dollár', 'Ross B. Girshick', 'P.

990334cf76845e2da64d3baa10b0a671e433d4b6;TorusE: Knowledge Graph Embedding on a Lie Group;Knowledge graphs are useful for many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts. To populate the graphs, knowledge graph embedding models have been developed. Knowledge graph embedding models map entities and relations in a knowledge graph to a vector space and predict unknown triples by scoring candidate triples. TransE is the first translation-based method and it is well known because of its simplicity and efficiency for knowledge graph completion. It employs the principle that the differences between entity embeddings represent their relations. The principle seems very simple, but it can effectively capture the rules of a knowledge graph. However, TransE has a problem with its regularization. TransE forces entity embeddings to be on a sphere in the embedding vector space.

54667e6bc8b370b41ffdc3310fa9b3e664e0cc94;Bilinear Graph Neural Network with Neighbor Interactions;Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a powerful model to learn representations and make predictions on graph data. Existing efforts on GNN have largely defined the graph convolution as a weighted sum of the features of the connected nodes to form the representation of the target node. Nevertheless, the operation of weighted sum assumes the neighbor nodes are independent of each other, and ignores the possible interactions between them. When such interactions exist, such as the co-occurrence of two neighbor nodes is a strong signal of the target node's characteristics, existing GNN models may fail to capture the signal. In this work, we argue the importance of modeling the interactions between neighbor nodes in GNN. We propose a new graph convolution operator, which augments the weighted sum with pairwise interactions of the representations of neighbor nodes. We term this framework as Bilinear Graph Neural Network (BGNN), which improves GNN representation ability;['2149670376', '2163400298', '7792071', '2144796537', '2694924', '144297772', '1699819'];['Hongmin Zhu', 'Fuli Feng', 'Xiangnan He', 'Xiang Wang', 'Yan Li', 'Kai Zheng', 'Yongdong Zhang'];67f7f831-711a-43c8-8785-1e09005359b5;International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence;conference;12;2020.0;Chicago;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science'];['3024f58826a5bce3378af94f677e8fb90cbb49e0', 'c5f5f179d80a3bf9b4f29750283a87eaca42e91b', '7e71eedb078181873a56f2adcfef9dddaeb95602', '5098df13be6d1f2a31c9fbf85703336ef77a9665', '62ed9bf1d83c8db1f9cbf92ea2f57ea90ef683d9', '967a21a111757d6af7f7a25ca7ea2bdf6d505098', '5aea95e1ae78a66474051a330ded374e199b658c', '2503dff90685857ce7295e37d0045e2eef41c8b8', '36652428740cd30d245d55889f01a7fb04a91c93', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', '0e779fd59353a7f1f5b559b9d65fa4bfe367890c', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '3d846cb01f6a975554035d2210b578ca61344b22', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d', '18b47b83a373f33d6b902a3615f42c10f7600d72', 'fff114cbba4f3ba900f33da574283e3de7f26c83']

41cbe3cdfee7539f8ff20144e6bd028ef762e00c;A Novel Embedding Model for Knowledge Base Completion Based on Convolutional Neural Network;In this paper, we propose a novel embedding model, named ConvKB, for knowledge base completion. Our model ConvKB advances state-of-the-art models by employing a convolutional neural network, so that it can capture global relationships and transitional characteristics between entities and relations in knowledge bases. In ConvKB, each triple (head entity, relation, tail entity) is represented as a 3-column matrix where each column vector represents a triple element. This 3-column matrix is then fed to a convolution layer where multiple filters are operated on the matrix to generate different feature maps. These feature maps are then concatenated into a single feature vector representing the input triple. The feature vector is multiplied with a weight vector via a dot product to return a score. This score is then used to predict whether the triple is valid or not. Experiments show that ConvKB achieves better link prediction performance than previous state-of-the-art embedding models;['38798269', '3314511', '34691913', '1749657'];['D. Q. Nguyen', 'T.

6667a57c8ffa3f3c0d724b1e8e986758995df2b8;Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks;Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) are the leading architecture for deep learning on graph-structured data, in large part due to their simplicity and scalability. Unfortunately, it was shown that these architectures are limited in their expressive power. This paper proposes a novel framework called Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks (ESAN) to address this issue. Our main observation is that while two graphs may not be distinguishable by an MPNN, they often contain distinguishable subgraphs. Thus, we propose to represent each graph as a set of subgraphs derived by some predefined policy, and to process it using a suitable equivariant architecture. We develop novel variants of the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test for graph isomorphism, and prove lower bounds on the expressiveness of ESAN in terms of these new WL variants. We further prove that our approach increases the expressive power of both MPNNs and more expressive architectures. Moreover, we provide theoretical results that;['2079900490', '51484149', '50436643', '2057595515', '2053992712', '2131004089', '1732570', '3416939'];['Beatrice Bevilacqua', 'Fabrizio Frasca', 'Derek Lim', 'Balasubramaniam Srinivasan', 'Chen Cai', 'G.

However, it is known that they do not improve (or sometimes worsen) their predictive performance as we pile up many layers and add non-lineality. To tackle this problem, we investigate the expressive power of graph NNs via their asymptotic behaviors as the layer size tends to infinity. Our strategy is to generalize the forward propagation of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which is a popular graph NN variant, as a specific dynamical system. In the case of a GCN, we show that when its weights satisfy the conditions determined by the spectra of the (augmented) normalized Laplacian, its output exponentially approaches the set of signals that carry information of the connected components and node degrees only for distinguishing nodes.

In this paper, we focus on learning an embedding space from urban data for urban regions. For the first time, we propose a multi-view joint learning model to learn comprehensive and representative urban region embeddings. We first model different types of region correlations based on both human mobility and inherent region properties. Then, we apply a graph attention mechanism in learning region representations from each view of the built correlations. Moreover, we introduce a joint learning module that boosts the region embedding learning by sharing cross-view information and fuses multi-view embeddings by learning adaptive weights.

Functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) were obtained from 19 children with ADHD and 20 healthy controls during resting state. Brain functional networks were constructed by thresholding the correlation matrix between 90 cortical and subcortical regions and further analyzed by applying graph theoretical approaches. Experimental results showed that, although brain networks of both groups exhibited economical small‐world topology, altered functional networks were demonstrated in the brain of ADHD when compared with the normal controls. In particular, increased local efficiencies combined with a decreasing tendency in global efficiencies found in ADHD suggested a disorder‐related shift of the topology toward regular networks. Additionally, significant alterations in nodal efficiency were also found in ADHD, involving prefrontal, temporal, and occipital cortex regions, which were compatible with previous ADHD studies.

d42d2a4112e0a751424624ac0b78980fa9fe9d96;GAKE: Graph Aware Knowledge Embedding;Knowledge embedding, which projects triples in a given knowledge base to d-dimensional vectors, has attracted considerable research efforts recently. Most existing approaches treat the given knowledge base as a set of triplets, each of whose representation is then learned separately. However, as a fact, triples are connected and depend on each other. In this paper, we propose a graph aware knowledge embedding method (GAKE), which formulates knowledge base as a directed graph, and learns representations for any vertices or edges by leveraging the graph’s structural information. We introduce three types of graph context for embedding: neighbor context, path context, and edge context, each reflects properties of knowledge from different perspectives. We also design an attention mechanism to learn representative power of different vertices or edges. To validate our method, we conduct several experiments on two tasks. Experimental results suggest that our method outperforms several state-of-art knowledge embedding models.;['2117000798', '1730108', '2152916921', '145213540'];['Jun Feng', 'Minlie Huang', 'Yang Yang', 'Xiaoyan Zhu'];f51ff783-cdff-4e22-94fb-28e6336d17b3;International Conference on Computational Linguistics;conference;6;2016.0;Berlin;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science'];['0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8', '994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726', '2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05', 'fff114cbba4f3ba900f33da574283e3de7f26c83', '2582ab7c70c9e7fcb84545944eba8f3a7f253248', '50d53cc562225549457cbc782546bfbe1ac6f0cf', '87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f', 'eb6208f3e2c0942e38ceffc443dcf64d2cb4ec82', '04cc04457e09e17897f9256c86b45b92d70a401f', '1f4a4769e4d2fb846e59c2f185e0377190739f18', '1976c9eeccc7115d18a04f1e7fb5145db6b96002']

In this work, we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach to extract useful representations from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive Predictive Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.;['3422336', '2144417088', '1689108'];['Aäron van den Oord', 'Yazhe Li', 'O.

Previous graph generation approaches have utilized relatively small molecular building blocks such as atoms or simple cycles, limiting their effectiveness to smaller molecules. Indeed, as we demonstrate, their performance degrades significantly for larger molecules. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical graph encoder-decoder that employs significantly larger and more flexible graph motifs as basic building blocks. Our encoder produces a multi-resolution representation for each molecule in a fine-to-coarse fashion, from atoms to connected motifs. Each level integrates the encoding of constituents below with the graph at that level. Our autoregressive coarse-to-fine decoder adds one motif at a time, interleaving the decision of selecting a new motif with the process of resolving its attachments to the emerging molecule. We evaluate our model on multiple molecule generation tasks, including polymers, and show that our model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines.;['2400119', '1741283', '35132120'];['Wengong Jin', 'R.

In previous studies it has been found that at fixation points luminance‐contrast is higher than average. This led to the hypothesis that luminance‐contrast makes a major contribution to a saliency map of visual overt attention, consistent with a computation of stimulus saliency in early visual cortical areas. We re‐evaluate this hypothesis by using natural and modified natural images to uncover the causal effects of luminance‐contrast to human overt visual attention and: (i) we confirm that when viewing natural images, contrasts are elevated at fixation points. This, however, only holds for low spatial frequencies and in a limited temporal window after stimulus onset; (ii) however, despite this correlation between overt attention and luminance‐contrast, moderate modifications of contrast in natural images do not measurably affect the selection of fixation points.

4f68caebe510a0d737759ee648daa3de4fc98627;Self-supervised Learning on Graphs: Deep Insights and New Direction;The success of deep learning notoriously requires larger amounts of costly annotated data. This has led to the development of self-supervised learning (SSL) that aims to alleviate this limitation by creating domain specific pretext tasks on unlabeled data. Simultaneously, there are increasing interests in generalizing deep learning to the graph domain in the form of graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs can naturally utilize unlabeled nodes through the simple neighborhood aggregation that is unable to thoroughly make use of unlabeled nodes. Thus, we seek to harness SSL for GNNs to fully exploit the unlabeled data. Different from data instances in the image and text domains, nodes in graphs present unique structure information and they are inherently linked indicating not independent and identically distributed (or i.i.d.). Such complexity is a double-edged sword for SSL on graphs. On the one hand, it determines that it is challenging to adopt solutions from the image;['144767914', '12524628', '66442354', '2108941389', '2893721', '2117940912', '1736632'];['Wei Jin', 'Tyler Derr', 'Haochen Liu', 'Yiqi Wang', 'Suhang Wang', 'Zitao Liu', 'Jiliang Tang'];;;;;;;ngry3lm9;ArXiv;2020.0;abs/2006.10141;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['43f2ad297941db230c089ba353efc3f281ab678c', '0a6a9e6d4e3efd7c69357769305b70097281655f', '7e71eedb078181873a56f2adcfef9dddaeb95602', 'ea5dd6a3d8f210d05e53a7b6fa5e16f1b115f693', '36652428740cd30d245d55889f01a7fb04a91c93', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '81a4fd3004df0eb05d6c1cef96ad33d5407820df']

In general, critical systems are associated with fractal or power law scaling, long-range correlations in space and time, and rapid reconfiguration in response to external inputs. Here, we consider two measures of phase synchronization: the phase-lock interval, or duration of coupling between a pair of (neurophysiological) processes, and the lability of global synchronization of a (brain functional) network. Using computational simulations of two mechanistically distinct systems displaying complex dynamics, the Ising model and the Kuramoto model, we show that both synchronization metrics have power law probability distributions specifically when these systems are in a critical state. We then demonstrate power law scaling of both pairwise and global synchronization metrics in functional MRI and magnetoencephalographic data recorded from normal volunteers under resting conditions.

2a6d160b529272964ce1a6707adf52f3d6ba4861;Diffusion Improves Graph Learning;Graph convolution is the core of most Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and usually approximated by message passing between direct (one-hop) neighbors. In this work, we remove the restriction of using only the direct neighbors by introducing a powerful, yet spatially localized graph convolution: Graph diffusion convolution (GDC). GDC leverages generalized graph diffusion, examples of which are the heat kernel and personalized PageRank. It alleviates the problem of noisy and often arbitrarily defined edges in real graphs. We show that GDC is closely related to spectral-based models and thus combines the strengths of both spatial (message passing) and spectral methods. We demonstrate that replacing message passing with graph diffusion convolution consistently leads to significant performance improvements across a wide range of models on both supervised and unsupervised tasks and a variety of datasets. Furthermore, GDC is not limited to GNNs but can trivially be combined with any graph-based model or algorithm;['51516539', '8350757', '3075189'];['Johannes Klicpera', 'Stefan Weißenberger', 'Stephan Günnemann'];d9720b90-d60b-48bc-9df8-87a30b9a60dd;Neural Information Processing Systems;conference;10;2019.0;São Paulo;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['63a513832f56addb67be81a2fa399b233f3030fc', '7e71eedb078181873a56f2adcfef9dddaeb95602', 'c2d40522eaa5523d67a0de5e4098e7031fdccb3d', '62ed9bf1d83c8db1f9cbf92ea2f57ea90ef683d9', '967a21a111757d6af7f7a25ca7ea2bdf6d505098', 'ac225094aab9e7b629bc5b3343e026dea0200c70', '5aea95e1ae78a66474051a330ded374e199b658c', '6c96c2d4a3fbd572fef2d59cb856521ee1746789', '51a2bc2e8fb8ed47a085df33dd965e57335080a0', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '9ba0186ed40656329c421f55ada7313293e13f17', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', 'e24cdf73b3e7e590c2fe5ecac9ae8aa983801367', 'f09f7888aa5aeaf88a2a44aea768d9a8747e97d2', '54906484f42e871f7c47bbfe784a358b1448231f', '97f7ef7a5332218e0e9ce75ad5cf77048466ca83', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '36ee2c8bd605afd48035d15fdc6b8c8842363376', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '7c6de5a9e02a779e24504619050c6118f4eac181', '492f57ee9ceb61fb5a47ad7aebfec1121887a175', '18b47b83a373f33d6b902a3615f42c10f7600d72', '5d1bfeed240709725c78bc72ea40e55410b373dc', 'fff114cbba4f3ba900f33da574283e3de7f26c83', '87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f', '168f28ac3c8c7ea63bf7ed25f2288e8b67e2fe74', '3efd851140aa28e95221b55fcc5659eea97b172d']

We hypothesize that what these systems lack is a ""relational inductive bias"": a capacity for reasoning about inter-object relations and making choices over a structured description of a scene. To test this hypothesis, we focus on a task that involves gluing pairs of blocks together to stabilize a tower, and quantify how well humans perform. We then introduce a deep reinforcement learning agent which uses object- and relation-centric scene and policy representations and apply it to the task. Our results show that these structured representations allow the agent to outperform both humans and more naive approaches, suggesting that relational inductive bias is an important component in solving structured reasoning problems and for building more intelligent, flexible machines.";['2158860', '145254624', '2603033', '2072832772', '47610458', '1763295', '2019153'];['Jessica B.

One similarity shared by GCNs and CNNs is the requirement of massive amount of labeled data for network training. In addition, GCNs need the adjacency matrix as input to define the relationship between those non-grid data, which leads to all of data including training, validation and test data typically forms only one graph structures data for training. Furthermore, the adjacency matrix is usually pre-defined and stationary, which makes the data augmentation strategies cannot be employed on the constructed graph structures data to augment the amount of training data. To further improve the learning capacity and model performance under the limited training data, in this paper, we propose two types of self-supervised learning strategies to exploit available information from the input graph structure data itself.

Capturing attribute-neighbourhood relationships over multiple scales is useful for a range of applications, including latent feature identification across disconnected networks with similar features.

Recently, in Collaborative Filtering~(CF) based Recommender Systems~(RS), by treating the user-item interaction behavior as a bipartite graph, some researchers model higher-layer collaborative signals with GCNs. These GCN based recommender models show superior performance compared to traditional works. However, these models suffer from training difficulty with non-linear activations for large user-item graphs. Besides, most GCN based models could not model deeper layers due to the over smoothing effect with the graph convolution operation. In this paper, we revisit GCN based CF models from two aspects. First, we empirically show that removing non-linearities would enhance recommendation performance, which is consistent with the theories in simple graph convolutional networks. Second, we propose a residual network structure that is specifically designed for CF with user-item interaction modeling, which alleviates the over;['2146071363', '2688093', '48043335', '40461583', '2146058571'];['Lei Chen', 'Le Wu', 'Richang Hong', 'Kun Zhang', 'Meng Wang'];bdc2e585-4e48-4e36-8af1-6d859763d405;AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence;conference;15;2020.0;Tokyo;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['c5f5f179d80a3bf9b4f29750283a87eaca42e91b', '9ae75ab09a9c0db08c5ec6a02ae940128f41e016', '7e71eedb078181873a56f2adcfef9dddaeb95602', '62ed9bf1d83c8db1f9cbf92ea2f57ea90ef683d9', 'ac225094aab9e7b629bc5b3343e026dea0200c70', 'f778186c42aac4822385ce43ebaeb79ac2ea5c1f', '5aea95e1ae78a66474051a330ded374e199b658c', '6c96c2d4a3fbd572fef2d59cb856521ee1746789', '36652428740cd30d245d55889f01a7fb04a91c93', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', 'e24cdf73b3e7e590c2fe5ecac9ae8aa983801367', 'ace1059fd85bbb8b41874a47a029bba7899124a5', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d']

The frameworks process large graphs in shared memory, requiring a terabyte of memory and expensive maintenance cost. Reducing graph size to fit in memory thus is crucial in cutting the cost of large-scale graph computation. Compression has been widely used to reduce graph size. However, it could meanwhile compromise graph computation efficiency caused by nontrivial decompression overhead before graph computation. In this paper, we propose a simple and yet efficient coding scheme. It not only leads to smaller size of compressed graphs; meanwhile we can perform graph computation directly on the compressed graphs with no or partial decompression, namely compression-aware computation, leading to faster running time. Our experiments validate that the coding scheme achieves 2.99X compression ratio, and three compression-aware graph algorithms achieve 7.02X, 2.88X and 2.34X faster running time than the graph algorithms";['2306490871', '144084147'];['Guohua Li', 'Weixiong Rao'];;;;;;;f36g2u8i;Proceedings of the 2016 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing: Adjunct;2016.0;81;['Graph', 'Computer Science'];['337bb008eb531c4e8152d6c99423e715ce0d9b05']

24a473700894dbfab0bfd9dc3d542acfeef66bca;Cross-Domain Recommendation via Preference Propagation GraphNet;Recommendation can be framed as a graph link prediction task naturally. The user-item interaction graph built within a single domain often suffers from high sparsity. Thus, there has been a surge of approaches to alleviate the sparsity issue via cross-domain mutual augmentation. The SOTA cross-domain recommendation algorithms all try to bridge the gap via knowledge transfer in the latent space. We find there are mainly three problems in their formulations: 1) their knowledge transfer is unaware of the cross-domain graph structure. 2) their framework cannot capture high-order information propagation on the graph. 3) their cross-domain transfer formulations are generally more complicated to be optimized than the unified methods. In this paper, we propose the Preference Propagation GraphNet (PPGN) to address the above problems. Specifically, we construct a Cross-Domain Preference Matrix (CDPM) to model the interactions of different domains as a whole.

While CNNs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in graph classification task, such methods are supervised and therefore steer away from the original problem of network representation in task-agnostic manner. Here, we coherently propose an approach for embedding entire graphs and show that our feature representations with SVM classifier increase classification accuracy of CNN algorithms and traditional graph kernels. For this we describe a recently discovered graph object, anonymous walk, on which we design task-independent algorithms for learning graph representations in explicit and distributed way. Overall, our work represents a new scalable unsupervised learning of state-of-the-art representations of entire graphs.;['2054725783', '51139941'];['Sergey Ivanov', 'Evgeny Burnaev'];fc0a208c-acb7-47dc-a0d4-af8190e21d29;International Conference on Machine Learning;conference;4;2018.0;Paris;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['ecf6c42d84351f34e1625a6a2e4cc6526da45c74', 'f09f7888aa5aeaf88a2a44aea768d9a8747e97d2', '7c6de5a9e02a779e24504619050c6118f4eac181', '87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f', 'f6b51c8753a871dc94ff32152c00c01e94f90f09']
4930de1aff4b1948157a15ac9cdb02364bee97bb;Graph Convolution over Pruned Dependency Trees Improves Relation Extraction;Dependency trees help relation extraction models capture long-range relations between words. However, existing dependency-based models either neglect crucial information (e.g., negation) by pruning the dependency trees too aggressively, or are computationally inefficient because it is difficult to parallelize over different tree structures. We propose an extension of graph convolutional networks that is tailored for relation extraction, which pools information over arbitrary dependency structures efficiently in parallel. To incorporate relevant information while maximally removing irrelevant content, we further apply a novel pruning strategy to the input trees by keeping words immediately around the shortest path between the two entities among which a relation might hold. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale TACRED dataset, outperforming existing sequence and dependency-based neural models. We also show through detailed analysis that this model has complementary strengths to sequence models, and combining them further improves the state of the art.;['49889487', '50531624', '144783904'];['Yuhao Zhang', 'Peng Qi', 'Christopher D.

We study synthetic graphs that model unstructured networks, such as social networks and economic transaction networks.

fa72afa9b2cbc8f0d7b05d52548906610ffbb9c5;Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate;Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based;['3335364', '1979489', '1751762'];['Dzmitry Bahdanau', 'Kyunghyun Cho', 'Yoshua Bengio'];939c6e1d-0d17-4d6e-8a82-66d960df0e40;International Conference on Learning Representations;conference;17;2014.0;Abuja;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];[]

Our approach, UGRAPHEMB, is a general framework that provides a novel means to performing graph-level embedding in a completely unsupervised and inductive manner. The learned neural network can be considered as a function that receives any graph as input, either seen or unseen in the training set, and transforms it into an embedding.

Recent studies have focused a lot on the potential of using machine learning (ML) to solve graph-based CO problems. Using ML- based CO methods, a graph has to be represented in numerical vectors, which is known as graph embedding. In this survey, we provide a thorough overview of recent graph embedding methods that have been used to solve CO problems.

4dbf5ab853c74d30ce118a13d83cc2a8ccaecada;Techniques for Inverted Index Compression;The data structure at the core of large-scale search engines is the inverted index, which is essentially a collection of sorted integer sequences called inverted lists. Because of the many documents indexed by such engines and stringent performance requirements imposed by the heavy load of queries, the inverted index stores billions of integers that must be searched efficiently. In this scenario, index compression is essential because it leads to a better exploitation of the computer memory hierarchy for faster query processing and, at the same time, allows reducing the number of storage machines. The aim of this article is twofold: first, surveying the encoding algorithms suitable for inverted index compression and, second, characterizing the performance of the inverted index through experimentation.;['11135785', '1797933'];['Giulio Ermanno Pibiri', 'Rossano Venturini'];;;;;;;pbx61pkq;ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR);2019.0;53;['Computer Science'];[]

The energy is defined on the space of boundaries in the image domain and can incorporate very general combinations of modeling information both from the boundary (intensity gradients, etc.) and from the interior of the region (texture, homogeneity, etc.). We describe two polynomial-time digraph algorithms for finding the global minima of this energy. One of the algorithms is completely general, minimizing the functional for any choice of modeling information. It runs in a few seconds on a 256/spl times/256 image. The other algorithm applies to a subclass of functionals, but has the advantage of being extremely parallelizable. Neither algorithm requires initialization.;['98095377', '66193516'];['Ian H.

We develop a framework that provides specific definitions of what it means for an image to be under- or over-segmented. We then present an efficient algorithm for computing a segmentation that is neither under- nor over-segmented according to these definitions. Our segmentation criterion is based on intensity differences between neighboring pixels. An important characteristic of the approach is that it is able to preserve detail in low-variability regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions, which we illustrate with several examples on both real and synthetic images.;['1685089', '1713089'];['Pedro F.

The analysis of the resulting model reveals that it can be viewed as an instance of the complex embeddings with a certain constraint imposed on the initial vectors upon training.

Since a reaction may involve hundreds of atoms, fully exploring the space of possible transformations is intractable. The current solution utilizes reaction templates to limit the space, but it suffers from coverage and efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a template-free approach to efficiently explore the space of product molecules by first pinpointing the reaction center -- the set of nodes and edges where graph edits occur. Since only a small number of atoms contribute to reaction center, we can directly enumerate candidate products. The generated candidates are scored by a Weisfeiler-Lehman Difference Network that models high-order interactions between changes occurring at nodes across the molecule. Our framework outperforms the top-performing template-based approach with a 10\% margin, while running orders of magnitude faster. Finally, we demonstrate that the model accuracy rivals the performance of domain experts.;['2400119', '13027820', '1741283', '35132120'];['Wengong Jin', 'Connor W. Coley', 'R. Barzilay', 'T.

We classify all linear partial differential operators in the Weyl algebra 𝒜n that preserve stability.

We characterize all multivariate multiplier sequences as well as those of finite order. Next, we establish a multivariate extension of the Cauchy–Poincaré interlacing theorem and prove a natural analog of the Lax conjecture for real stable polynomials in two variables. Using the latter we describe all operators in 𝒜1 that preserve univariate hyperbolic polynomials by means of determinants and homogenized symbols. Our methods also yield homotopical properties for symbols of linear stability preservers and a duality theorem showing that an operator in 𝒜n preserves stability if and only if its Fischer–Fock adjoint does.

Consequently, an effective social influence prediction for each user is critical for a variety of applications such as online recommendation and advertising. Conventional social influence prediction approaches typically design various hand-crafted rules to extract user- and network-specific features. However, their effectiveness heavily relies on the knowledge of domain experts. As a result, it is usually difficult to generalize them into different domains. Inspired by the recent success of deep neural networks in a wide range of computing applications, we design an end-to-end framework, DeepInf, to learn users' latent feature representation for predicting social influence. In general, DeepInf takes a user's local network as the input to a graph neural network for learning her latent;['40125294', '152226504', '144988795', '2047998', '1748169', '46199760'];['J.

Recently, a range of approaches based on graph kernels or graph neural networks have been developed for graph classification and for representation learning on graphs in general. As the developed methodologies become more sophisticated, it is important to understand which components of the increasingly complex methods are necessary or most effective. As a first step, we develop a simple yet meaningful graph representation, and explore its effectiveness in graph classification. We test our baseline representation for the graph classification task on a range of graph datasets. Interestingly, this simple representation achieves similar performance as the state-of-the-art graph kernels and graph neural networks for non-attributed graph classification. Its performance on classifying attributed graphs is slightly weaker as it does not incorporate attributes.

One way to extend beyond words is to compare two tuples using a function that combines pairwise similarities between the component words in the tuples. A strength of this approach is that it works with both relational similarity (analogy) and compositional similarity (paraphrase). However, past work required hand-coding the combination function for different tasks. The main contribution of this paper is that combination functions are generated by supervised learning.

74606b052a17dd425bcc6cd1d05db153633c742a;Discriminative Gaifman Models;We present discriminative Gaifman models, a novel family of relational machine learning models. Gaifman models learn feature representations bottom up from representations of locally connected and bounded-size regions of knowledge bases (KBs). Considering local and bounded-size neighborhoods of knowledge bases renders logical inference and learning tractable, mitigates the problem of overfitting, and facilitates weight sharing. Gaifman models sample neighborhoods of knowledge bases so as to make the learned relational models more robust to missing objects and relations which is a common situation in open-world KBs. We present the core ideas of Gaifman models and apply them to large-scale relational learning problems. We also discuss the ways in which Gaifman models relate to some existing relational machine learning approaches.;['2780262'];['Mathias Niepert'];d9720b90-d60b-48bc-9df8-87a30b9a60dd;Neural Information Processing Systems;conference;14;2016.0;Barcelona;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['2218e2e1df2c3adfb70e0def2e326a39928aacfc', '994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726', '2582ab7c70c9e7fcb84545944eba8f3a7f253248', '50d53cc562225549457cbc782546bfbe1ac6f0cf', '04cc04457e09e17897f9256c86b45b92d70a401f', '1f4a4769e4d2fb846e59c2f185e0377190739f18', '1976c9eeccc7115d18a04f1e7fb5145db6b96002']

In this paper we describe how to use Relation Networks (RNs) as a simple plug-and-play module to solve problems that fundamentally hinge on relational reasoning. We tested RN-augmented networks on three tasks: visual question answering using a challenging dataset called CLEVR, on which we achieve state-of-the-art, super-human performance; text-based question answering using the bAbI suite of tasks; and complex reasoning about dynamic physical systems. Then, using a curated dataset called Sort-of-CLEVR we show that powerful convolutional networks do not have a general capacity to solve relational questions, but can gain this capacity when augmented with RNs. Our work shows how a deep learning architecture equipped with an RN module can implicitly discover and learn to reason about entities and their relations.";['35030998', '143724694', '50181861', '145478807', '1996134', '2019153', '2542999'];['Adam Santoro', 'David Raposo', 'D.

Despite their proliferation, currently there is no study of their robustness to adversarial attacks. Yet, in domains where they are likely to be used, e.g. the web, adversaries are common. Can deep learning models for graphs be easily fooled? In this work, we introduce the first study of adversarial attacks on attributed graphs, specifically focusing on models exploiting ideas of graph convolutions. In addition to attacks at test time, we tackle the more challenging class of poisoning/causative attacks, which focus on the training phase of a machine learning model.We generate adversarial perturbations targeting the node's features and the graph structure, thus, taking the dependencies between instances in account. Moreover, we ensure that the perturbations remain unnoticeable by preserving important data characteristics. To cope with the underlying discrete domain we propose an efficient algorithm Nettack exploiting;['3156540', '46256784', '3075189'];['Daniel Zügner', 'Amir Akbarnejad', 'Stephan Günnemann'];a0edb93b-1e95-4128-a295-6b1659149cef;Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining;conference;7;2018.0;Houston;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Neural Networks'];['ac225094aab9e7b629bc5b3343e026dea0200c70', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', 'e24cdf73b3e7e590c2fe5ecac9ae8aa983801367', 'f09f7888aa5aeaf88a2a44aea768d9a8747e97d2', '97f7ef7a5332218e0e9ce75ad5cf77048466ca83', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '36ee2c8bd605afd48035d15fdc6b8c8842363376', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', 'fff114cbba4f3ba900f33da574283e3de7f26c83', 'a92d7de31100a0fee816f0cb61b4a2a5a2d5e37a']

We reveal that much of the performance gains of word embeddings are due to certain system design choices and hyperparameter optimizations, rather than the embedding algorithms themselves. Furthermore, we show that these modifications can be transferred to traditional distributional models, yielding similar gains. In contrast to prior reports, we observe mostly local or insignificant performance differences between the methods, with no global advantage to any single approach over the others.;['39455775', '2089067', '7465342'];['Omer Levy', 'Yoav Goldberg', 'Ido Dagan'];;;;;;;fdn4otig;Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics;2015.0;3;['Computer Science'];['f37e1b62a767a307c046404ca96bc140b3e68cb5', '87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f', '53ab89807caead278d3deb7b6a4180b277d3cb77', 'c4fd9c86b2b41df51a6fe212406dda81b1997fd4', 'f6b51c8753a871dc94ff32152c00c01e94f90f09']

Examples include clustering, learning vertex and edge features on graphs, and learning features on triplets in a collection. A natural approach for building Set2Graph models is to characterize all linear equivariant set-to-hypergraph layers and stack them with non-linear activations. This poses two challenges: (i) the expressive power of these networks is not well understood; and (ii) these models would suffer from high, often intractable computational and memory complexity, as their dimension grows exponentially. This paper advocates a family of neural network models for learning Set2Graph functions that is both practical and of maximal expressive power (universal), that is, can approximate arbitrary continuous Set2Graph functions over compact sets.

However, because knowledge bases are typically incomplete, it is useful to be able to perform link prediction or knowledge base completion, i.e., predict whether a relationship not in the knowledge base is likely to be true. This paper combines insights from several previous link prediction models into a new embedding model STransE that represents each entity as a low-dimensional vector, and each relation by two matrices and a translation vector. STransE is a simple combination of the SE and TransE models, but it obtains better link prediction performance on two benchmark datasets than previous embedding models. Thus, STransE can serve as a new baseline for the more complex models in the link prediction task.;['34691913', '2132289', '14564042', '145177220'];['Dat Quoc Nguyen', 'Kairit Sirts', 'Lizhen Qu', 'Mark Johnson'];01103732-3808-4930-b8e4-7e9e68d5c68d;North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics;conference;9;2016.0;São Paulo;;;;;['Computer Science'];['d42d2a4112e0a751424624ac0b78980fa9fe9d96', '74606b052a17dd425bcc6cd1d05db153633c742a', '6a86696974d5d49b4b9be6bd10ffcf92f996f4db', '2218e2e1df2c3adfb70e0def2e326a39928aacfc', '955fe2ee26d888ae22749b0853981b8b581b133d', '994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726', '2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05', '2582ab7c70c9e7fcb84545944eba8f3a7f253248', '50d53cc562225549457cbc782546bfbe1ac6f0cf', 'c4fd9c86b2b41df51a6fe212406dda81b1997fd4', 'eb6208f3e2c0942e38ceffc443dcf64d2cb4ec82', '04cc04457e09e17897f9256c86b45b92d70a401f', '1f4a4769e4d2fb846e59c2f185e0377190739f18', '1976c9eeccc7115d18a04f1e7fb5145db6b96002']

A differential expression (DE) analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and bioinformatic analyses were performed. A total of 18,016 novel circular RNAs (circRNAs) were detected in GCs and TCs, 8127 of which were abundantly expressed in both cell types. and more circRNAs were differentially expressed between GCs and TCs than mRNAs.

In particular, studies have focused on generalizing convolutional neural networks to graph data, which includes redefining the convolution and the downsampling (pooling) operations for graphs. The method of generalizing the convolution operation to graphs has been proven to improve performance and is widely used. However, the method of applying downsampling to graphs is still difficult to perform and has room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a graph pooling method based on self-attention. Self-attention using graph convolution allows our pooling method to consider both node features and graph topology.

We extend this line of work by imposing hyperbolic geometry on the activations of neural networks. This allows us to exploit hyperbolic geometry to reason about embeddings produced by deep networks.

facf11419e149a03bd4a9bffdda2ebb433a59d85;Equivariant and Stable Positional Encoding for More Powerful Graph Neural Networks;Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown great advantages in many graph-based learning tasks but often fail to predict accurately for a task-based on sets of nodes such as link/motif prediction and so on. Many works have recently proposed to address this problem by using random node features or node distance features. However, they suffer from either slow convergence, inaccurate prediction, or high complexity. In this work, we revisit GNNs that allow using positional features of nodes given by positional encoding (PE) techniques such as Laplacian Eigenmap, Deepwalk, etc. GNNs with PE often get criticized because they are not generalizable to unseen graphs (inductive) or stable. Here, we study these issues in a principled way and propose a provable solution, a class of GNN layers termed PEG with rigorous mathematical analysis. PEG uses separate channels to update the original node features and positional features. PEG imposes permutation equivariance w.r.t. the original;['2359832', '26379330', '1390814008', '1561672016'];['Hongya Wang', 'Haoteng Yin', 'Muhan Zhang', 'Pan Li'];939c6e1d-0d17-4d6e-8a82-66d960df0e40;International Conference on Learning Representations;conference;10;2022.0;Houston;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Neural Networks'];['eb984b142db9965b10a3b5ae5813eeb3e0f6e676', '454304628bf10f02aba1c2cfc95891e94d09208e', '47ae807cd511b35e78a2cd4e198283dea6dafd41', '5863d7b35ea317c19f707376978ef1cc53e3534c', '8ea9cb53779a8c1bb0e53764f88669bd7edf38f0', '597bd2e45427563cdf025e53a3239006aa364cfc', '135334ea7fdef8eef0367e862797cac7dcd232a4', '6b010e07618eb36abe6def23d94488b2c81ecbf7', '6ea57a2aea08ce0628c93f77bdc24c2f3e9cc6da', 'ac225094aab9e7b629bc5b3343e026dea0200c70', 'e4715a13f6364b1c81e64f247651c3d9e80b6808', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', 'b7c4570d7d97f327e7f82fe28100172ec5e94cac', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', 'e24cdf73b3e7e590c2fe5ecac9ae8aa983801367', '54906484f42e871f7c47bbfe784a358b1448231f', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '36ee2c8bd605afd48035d15fdc6b8c8842363376', '3d846cb01f6a975554035d2210b578ca61344b22', '0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8', 'fff114cbba4f3ba900f33da574283e3de7f26c83', '87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f', '3efd851140aa28e95221b55fcc5659eea97b172d']

(2018) have called into question the utility of pre-training by showing that training from scratch can often yield similar performance to pre-training. We show that although pre-training may not improve performance on traditional classification metrics, it improves model robustness and uncertainty estimates. Through extensive experiments on adversarial examples, label corruption, class imbalance, out-of-distribution detection, and confidence calibration, we demonstrate large gains from pre-training and complementary effects with task-specific methods. We introduce adversarial pre-training and show approximately a 10% absolute improvement over the previous state-of-the-art in adversarial robustness. In some cases, using pre-training without task-specific methods also surpasses the state-of-the-art, highlighting the need for pre-training when evaluating future methods on robustness and uncertainty tasks.;['3422872', '3436470', '16787428'];['Dan Hendrycks', 'Kimin Lee', 'Mantas Mazeika'];fc0a208c-acb7-47dc-a0d4-af8190e21d29;International Conference on Machine Learning;conference;3;2019.0;New York;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['6296aa7cab06eaf058f7291040b320b5a83c0091', '41071dbbbcbb27af3fec70de045f19c28535f5b7']

However, the ever growing size of knowledge graphs requires computationally efficient algorithms capable of scaling to graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges. This paper presents DGL-KE, an open-source package to efficiently compute knowledge graph embeddings. DGL-KE introduces various novel optimizations that accelerate training on knowledge graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges using multi-processing, multi-GPU, and distributed parallelism. These optimizations are designed to increase data locality, reduce communication overhead, overlap computations with memory accesses, and achieve high operation efficiency.

From a small collection of positive and negative examples, the system learns the concept and uses it to retrieve images that contain the concept from a large database. The learned ""concepts"" are simple templates that capture the color, texture and spatial properties of the class of images.

Even though there has been a large body of research on generating recommendations based on modeling user-item interaction sequences, few of them attempt to represent and transfer these models for serving downstream tasks where only limited data exists. In this paper, we delve on the task of effectively learning a single user representation that can be applied to a diversity of tasks, from cross-domain recommendations to user profile predictions. Fine-tuning a large pre-trained network and adapting it to downstream tasks is an effective way to solve such tasks. However, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient considering that an entire model needs to be re-trained for every new task. To overcome this issue, we develop a parameter-efficient transfer learning architecture, termed as PeterRec, which can be configured on-the-fly;['2612614', '7792071', '1713164', '3164962'];['Fajie Yuan', 'Xiangnan He', 'Alexandros Karatzoglou', 'Liguang Zhang'];8dce23a9-44e0-4381-a39e-2acc1edff700;Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval;conference;20;2020.0;Sydney;;;;;['Computer Science'];['3024f58826a5bce3378af94f677e8fb90cbb49e0', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d', 'a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8']

Then it finds a segmentation map that maps each pixel to the level with the closest gray value to the pixel data, within a smoothness constraint.

54575fec0a24ea3daf1512e209ba4fab4c3d53f0;HOP-rec: high-order proximity for implicit recommendation;"Recommender systems are vital ingredients for many e-commerce services. In the literature, two of the most popular approaches are based on factorization and graph-based models; the former approach captures user preferences by factorizing the observed direct interactions between users and items, and the latter extracts indirect preferences from the graphs constructed by user-item interactions. In this paper we present HOP-Rec, a unified and efficient method that incorporates the two approaches. The proposed method involves random surfing on a graph to harvest high-order information among neighborhood items for each user. Instead of factorizing a transition matrix, our method introduces a confidence weighting parameter to simulate all high-order information simultaneously, for which we maintain a sparse user-item interaction matrix and enrich the matrix for each user using random walks. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art on a range of large-scale real-world datasets.";['1410146097', '1764277', '1808412', '1793168'];['Jheng-Hong Yang', 'Chih-Ming Chen', 'Chuan-Ju Wang', 'Ming-Feng Tsai'];61275a16-1e0d-479f-ac4e-f295310761f0;ACM Conference on Recommender Systems;conference;6;2018.0;Paris;;;;;['Computer Science'];[]
f71f8087c20c6d6fd78de522aeab35e82c5b61cf;Reinforced Negative Sampling for Recommendation with Exposure Data;In implicit feedback-based recommender systems, user exposure data, which record whether or not a recommended item has been interacted by a user, provide an important clue on selecting negative training samples. In this work, we improve the negative sampler by integrating the exposure data. We propose to generate high-quality negative instances by adversarial training to favour the difﬁcult instances, and by optimizing additional objective to favour the real negatives in exposure data. However, this idea is non-trivial to implement since the distribution of exposure data is latent and the item space is discrete. To this end, we design a novel RNS method (short for Reinforced Negative Sampler) that generates exposure-alike negative instances through feature matching technique instead of directly choosing from exposure data. Optimized under the reinforcement learning framework, RNS is able to integrate user preference signals in exposure data and hard negatives. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate;['2470644', '51055845', '7792071', '39948674', '49953590'];['Jingtao Ding', 'Yuhan Quan', 'Xiangnan He', 'Yong Li', 'Depeng Jin'];67f7f831-711a-43c8-8785-1e09005359b5;International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence;conference;4;2019.0;Los Angeles;;;;;['Computer Science'];['6296aa7cab06eaf058f7291040b320b5a83c0091', '73047a0f0192a35d3b5c6f5ebeadf3706b17e4dc']

Based on our linked data set, we first preform qualitative analysis experiments, and then we discuss the effect of two important factors (i.e., popularity and recency) on whether a RS item can be linked to a KB entity.

015395cd36b17f30050c8f2449db669de172200c;Aspect-Level Deep Collaborative Filtering via Heterogeneous Information Networks;Latent factor models have been widely used for recommendation. Most existing latent factor models mainly utilize the rating information between users and items, although some recently extended models add some auxiliary information to learn a unified latent factor between users and items. The unified latent factor only represents the latent features of users and items from the aspect of purchase history. However, the latent features of users and items may stem from different aspects, e.g., the brand-aspect and category-aspect of items. In this paper, we propose a Neural network based Aspect-level Collaborative Filtering model (NeuACF) to exploit different aspect latent factors. Through modelling rich objects and relations in recommender system as a heterogeneous information network, NeuACF first extracts different aspect-level similarity matrices of users and items through different meta-paths and then feeds an elaborately designed deep neural network with these matrices to learn aspect-level latent factors. Finally, the aspect-level latent;['50017230', '144123161', '3210262', '144019071', '144157700'];['Xiaotian Han', 'C. Shi', 'Senzhang Wang', 'Philip S. Yu', 'L.

However, one fundamental but vital issue of the impact of different brain parcellation schemes on the network topological architecture remains unclear. Here, we used resting‐state functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate the influences of different brain parcellation atlases on the topological organization of brain functional networks. Whole‐brain fMRI data were divided into ninety and seventy regions of interest according to two predefined anatomical atlases, respectively. Brain functional networks were constructed by thresholding the correlation matrices among the parcellated regions and further analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Both atlas‐based brain functional networks were found to show robust small‐world properties and truncated power‐law connectivity degree distributions, which are consistent with previous brain functional and structural networks studies. However, more importantly, we found that there were significant differences in multiple topological parameters (e.g.,;['38612176', '2144691867', '143656578', '2118608695', '4957695', '143838620', '145549098', '7883654', '145475635'];['Jinhui Wang', 'Liang Wang', 'Y.

The central problem in the study of relational inference is to infer unknown relations between entities from the facts given in the knowledge bases. Two popular models have been put forth recently to solve this problem, which are the latent factor models and the random-walk models, respectively. However, each of them has their pros and cons, depending on their computational efficiency and inference accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical random-walk inference algorithm for relational learning in large scale graph-structured knowledge bases, which not only maintains the computational simplicity of the random-walk models, but also provides better inference accuracy than related works. The improvements come from two basic assumptions we proposed in this paper. Firstly, we assume that although a relation between two entities is syntactically directional, the information conveyed by this relation is equally shared between the connected;['143673083', '2112516595', '35083046', '2108924230', '2256481781'];['Qiao Liu', 'Liuyi Jiang', 'Minghao Han', 'Yao Liu', 'Zhiguang Qin'];8dce23a9-44e0-4381-a39e-2acc1edff700;Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval;conference;1;2016.0;Los Angeles;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science'];['994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726', '2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05', '2582ab7c70c9e7fcb84545944eba8f3a7f253248', '1f4a4769e4d2fb846e59c2f185e0377190739f18', '5ad41f9ebbc6b6b02d61932a15ae254ba33a687f']

While convolutional neural networks have proven to be the first choice for images, audio and video data, the atoms in molecules are not restricted to a grid. Instead, their precise locations contain essential physical information, that would get lost if discretized. Thus, we propose to use continuous-filter convolutional layers to be able to model local correlations without requiring the data to lie on a grid. We apply those layers in SchNet: a novel deep learning architecture modeling quantum interactions in molecules.

This issue is particularly challenging for understanding casual and correlational relationships between events. While this topic has received a lot of interest in the NLP community, research has been hindered by the lack of a proper evaluation framework. This paper attempts to address this problem with a new framework for evaluating story understanding and script learning: the 'Story Cloze Test'. This test requires a system to choose the correct ending to a four-sentence story. We created a new corpus of ~50k five-sentence commonsense stories, ROCStories, to enable this evaluation. This corpus is unique in two ways: (1) it captures a rich set of causal and temporal commonsense relations between daily events, and (2) it is a high quality collection of everyday life stories that can also be used for story;['2400138', '1729918', '144137069', '153432684', '1746610', '1909300', '143967473', '145844737'];['N.

ecf6c42d84351f34e1625a6a2e4cc6526da45c74;Representation Learning on Graphs: Methods and Applications;Machine learning on graphs is an important and ubiquitous task with applications ranging from drug design to friendship recommendation in social networks. The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a;['49437682', '83539859', '1702139'];['William L. Hamilton', 'Rex Ying', 'J.

Previous work attacked this problem by inducing new translation rules from monolingual data with a semi-supervised algorithm. However, this approach does not scale very well since it is very computationally expensive to generate new translation rules for only a few thousand sentences. We propose a much faster and simpler method that directly hallucinates translation rules for infrequent phrases based on phrases with similar continuous representations for which a translation is known. To speed up the retrieval of similar phrases, we investigate approximated nearest neighbor search with redundant bit vectors which we find to be three times faster and significantly more accurate than locality sensitive hashing. Our approach of learning new translation rules improves a phrase-based baseline by up to 1.6 BLEU on Arabic-English translation, it is three-orders of magnitudes faster than existing semi-supervised methods and 0.5 BLEU;['145341916', '143925074', '2325985'];['Kai Zhao', 'Hany Hassan', 'Michael Auli'];01103732-3808-4930-b8e4-7e9e68d5c68d;North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics;conference;10;2015.0;Beijing;;;;;['Computer Science'];['87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f', 'c4fd9c86b2b41df51a6fe212406dda81b1997fd4', 'bc1022b031dc6c7019696492e8116598097a8c12']

dcdf7774ee9b2de1ec307f2a53e3f44036dff6a1;PME: Projected Metric Embedding on Heterogeneous Networks for Link Prediction;Heterogenous information network embedding aims to embed heterogenous information networks (HINs) into low dimensional spaces, in which each vertex is represented as a low-dimensional vector, and both global and local network structures in the original space are preserved. However, most of existing heterogenous information network embedding models adopt the dot product to measure the proximity in the low dimensional space, and thus they can only preserve the first-order proximity and are insufficient to capture the global structure. Compared with homogenous information networks, there are multiple types of links (i.e., multiple relations) in HINs, and the link distribution w.r.t relations is highly skewed. To address the above challenging issues, we propose a novel heterogenous information network embedding model PME based on the metric learning to capture both first-order and second-order proximities in a unified way.

It is challenging to develop effective methods for HIN based recommendation in both extraction and exploitation of the information from HINs. Most of HIN based recommendation methods rely on path based similarity, which cannot fully mine latent structure features of users and items. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous network embedding based approach for HIN based recommendation, called HERec. To embed HINs, we design a meta-path based random walk strategy to generate meaningful node sequences for network embedding. The learned node embeddings are first transformed by a set of fusion functions, and subsequently integrated into an extended matrix factorization (MF) model. The extended MF model together with fusion functions are jointly optimized for the rating prediction task. Extensive experiments;['144123161', '145743766', '2542603', '144019071'];['C.

Standard examples include the Web graph and various social networks. The scale of these graphs—in some cases billions of vertices, trillions of edges—poses challenges to their efficient processing. Despite the ubiquity of large graphs and their commercial importance, we know of no scalable general-purpose system for implementing graph algorithms in a distributed environment. To address distributed processing of real-life graphs, we defined a model of computation and realized it through a scalable and fault-tolerant system called Pregel, with an expressive and flexible API. The high-level organization of Pregel programs is inspired by Valiant’s Bulk Synchronous Parallel model. Pregel computations consist of a sequence of iterations, called superstep s. During a superstep the framework invokes a userdefined Compute() function for each vertex, conceptually in parallel. The function specifies behavior at a single vertex v and a single superstep S. It can read messages sent;['1766747', '2268793', '144211012', '2381974', '40607909', '1858799', '2911719'];['G. Malewicz', 'Matthew H. Austern', 'Aart J. C. Bik', 'James C. Dehnert', 'I.

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging.;['46865129', '153652147'];['Jianbo Shi', 'J.

Properties of the mean shift are reviewed and its convergence on lattices is proven. The proposed filtering method associates with each pixel in the image the closest local mode in the density distribution of the joint domain. Segmentation into a piecewise constant structure requires only one more step, fusion of the regions associated with nearby modes. The proposed technique has two parameters controlling the resolution in the spatial and range domains. Since convergence is guaranteed, the technique does not require the intervention of the user to stop the filtering at the desired image quality. Several examples, for gray and color images, show the versatility of the method and compare favorably with results described in the literature for the same images.;['1685020', '145776090'];['D.

We investigated to what extent the characteristic features of small‐world networks are genetically determined. To represent functional connectivity between brain areas, we measured resting EEG in 574 twins and their siblings and calculated the synchronization likelihood between each pair of electrodes. We applied a threshold to obtain a binary graph from which we calculated the clustering coefficient C (describing local interconnectedness) and average path length L (describing global interconnectedness) for each individual. Modeling of MZ and DZ twin and sibling resemblance indicated that across various frequency bands 46–89% of the individual differences in C and 37–62% of the individual differences in L are heritable. It is asserted that C, L, and a small‐world organization are viable markers of genetic differences in brain organization.

99f319ab72ae43f0ac94fe7ff1891be524611483;Relevance of Rotationally Equivariant Convolutions for Predicting Molecular Properties;Equivariant neural networks (ENNs) are graph neural networks embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and are well suited for predicting molecular properties. The ENN library e3nn has customizable convolutions, which can be designed to depend only on distances between points, or also on angular features, making them rotationally invariant, or equivariant, respectively. This paper studies the practical value of including angular dependencies for molecular property prediction using the QM9 data set. We find that for fixed network depth, adding angular features improves the accuracy on most targets. For most, but not all, molecular properties, distance-only e3nns (L0Nets) can compensate by increasing convolutional layer depth. Our angular-feature e3nn (L1Net) architecture beats previous state-of-the-art results on the global electronic properties dipole moment, isotropic polarizability, and electronic spatial extent.;['2101487552', '31784839', '5485763', '2064855776'];"['Benjamin Kurt Miller', 'M.

But human intelligence is more than just pattern recognition. And no machine system yet built has anything like the flexible, general-purpose commonsense grasp of the world that we can see in even a one-year-old human infant. I will consider how we might capture the basic learning and thinking abilities humans possess from early childhood, as one route to building more human-like forms of machine learning and thinking. At the heart of human common sense is our ability to model the physical and social environment around us: to explain and understand what we see, to imagine things we could see but haven't yet, to solve problems and plan actions to make these things real, and to build new models as we learn more about the;['1763295'];['J.

Compressing such datasets can accelerate graph processing by reducing the amount of I/O accesses and the pressure on the memory subsystem. Yet, selecting a proper compression method is challenging as there exist a plethora of techniques, algorithms, domains, and approaches in compressing graphs. To facilitate this, we present a survey and taxonomy on lossless graph compression that is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to exhaustively analyze this domain. Moreover, our survey does not only categorize existing schemes, but also explains key ideas, discusses formal underpinning in selected works, and describes the space of the existing compression schemes using three dimensions: areas of research (e.g., compressing web graphs), techniques (e.g., gap encoding), and features (e.g., whether or not a given scheme targets dynamic graphs).

We present and empirically evaluate a set of multi-level recurrent neural network language models, called Document-Context Language Models (DCLM), which incorporate contextual information both within and beyond the sentence.

Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework.

5863d7b35ea317c19f707376978ef1cc53e3534c;Rethinking Graph Transformers with Spectral Attention;In recent years, the Transformer architecture has proven to be very successful in sequence processing, but its application to other data structures, such as graphs, has remained limited due to the difficulty of properly defining positions. Here, we present the $\textit{Spectral Attention Network}$ (SAN), which uses a learned positional encoding (LPE) that can take advantage of the full Laplacian spectrum to learn the position of each node in a given graph. This LPE is then added to the node features of the graph and passed to a fully-connected Transformer. By leveraging the full spectrum of the Laplacian, our model is theoretically powerful in distinguishing graphs, and can better detect similar sub-structures from their resonance. Further, by fully connecting the graph, the Transformer does not suffer from over-squashing, an information bottleneck of most GNNs, and enables better modeling of physical phenomenons such as heat transfer and electric interaction.

Analysis of the query log from our academic search engine, SemanticScholar.org, reveals that a major error source is its inability to understand the meaning of research concepts in queries. To addresses this challenge, ESR represents queries and documents in the entity space and ranks them based on their semantic connections from their knowledge graph embedding.

Current filters in graph CNNs are built for fixed and shared graph structure. However, for most real data, the graph structures varies in both size and connectivity. The paper proposes a generalized and flexible graph CNN taking data of arbitrary graph structure as input. In that way a task-driven adaptive graph is learned for each graph data while training. To efficiently learn the graph, a distance metric learning is proposed. Extensive experiments on nine graph-structured datasets have demonstrated the superior performance improvement on both convergence speed and predictive accuracy.;['2112079647', '2151484950', '37921272', '1768190'];['Ruoyu Li', 'Sheng Wang', 'Feiyun Zhu', 'Junzhou Huang'];bdc2e585-4e48-4e36-8af1-6d859763d405;AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence;conference;16;2018.0;Los Angeles;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Neural Networks'];['1a39bb2caa151d15efd6718f3a80d9f4bff95af2', 'd997beefc0922d97202789d2ac307c55c2c52fba', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '5d1bfeed240709725c78bc72ea40e55410b373dc']
6bc4004347cdf76d84597210796f38fcf7a01a80;Directional Message Passing for Molecular Graphs;Graph neural networks have recently achieved great successes in predicting quantum mechanical properties of molecules. These models represent a molecule as a graph using only the distance between atoms (nodes) and not the spatial direction from one atom to another. However, directional information plays a central role in empirical potentials for molecules, e.g. in angular potentials. To alleviate this limitation we propose directional message passing, in which we embed the messages passed between atoms instead of the atoms themselves. Each message is associated with a direction in coordinate space. These directional message embeddings are rotationally equivariant since the associated directions rotate with the molecule. We propose a message passing scheme analogous to belief propagation, which uses the directional information by transforming messages based on the angle between them. Additionally, we use spherical Bessel functions to construct a theoretically well-founded, orthogonal radial basis that achieves better performance than the currently prevalent;['51516539', '1557081085', '3075189'];['Johannes Klicpera', 'Janek Groß', 'Stephan Günnemann'];939c6e1d-0d17-4d6e-8a82-66d960df0e40;International Conference on Learning Representations;conference;15;2020.0;Tokyo;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Physics'];['6ea57a2aea08ce0628c93f77bdc24c2f3e9cc6da', '62ed9bf1d83c8db1f9cbf92ea2f57ea90ef683d9', 'ac225094aab9e7b629bc5b3343e026dea0200c70', '5bf31dc4bd54b623008c13f8bc8954dc7c9a2d80', 'e24cdf73b3e7e590c2fe5ecac9ae8aa983801367', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', '2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d', '5d1bfeed240709725c78bc72ea40e55410b373dc', '3efd851140aa28e95221b55fcc5659eea97b172d']

We show that unlike visual representation learning, increasing the number of views to more than two or contrasting multi-scale encodings do not improve performance, and the best performance is achieved by contrasting encodings from first-order neighbors and a graph diffusion. We achieve new state-of-the-art results in self-supervised learning on 8 out of 8 node and graph classification benchmarks under the linear evaluation protocol. For example, on Cora (node) and Reddit-Binary (graph) classification benchmarks, we achieve 86.8% and 84.5% accuracy, which are 5.5% and 2.4% relative improvements over previous state-of-the-art.

8573393e8b14e3011ae6ee91dc7bbde7077633c1;Label Efficient Semi-Supervised Learning via Graph Filtering;Graph-based methods have been demonstrated as one of the most effective approaches for semi-supervised learning, as they can exploit the connectivity patterns between labeled and unlabeled data samples to improve learning performance. However, existing graph-based methods either are limited in their ability to jointly model graph structures and data features, such as the classical label propagation methods, or require a considerable amount of labeled data for training and validation due to high model complexity, such as the recent neural-network-based methods. In this paper, we address label efficient semi-supervised learning from a graph filtering perspective. Specifically, we propose a graph filtering framework that injects graph similarity into data features by taking them as signals on the graph and applying a low-pass graph filter to extract useful data representations for classification, where label efficiency can be achieved by conveniently adjusting the strength of the graph filter. Interestingly, this framework unifies two seemingly;['35692225', '19195265', '73623714', '49470539', '2053577281'];['Qimai Li', 'Xiao-Ming Wu', '刘晗', 'Xiaotong Zhang', 'Zhichao Guan'];768b87bb-8a18-4d9c-a161-4d483c776bcf;Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition;conference;9;2019.0;London;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];['ea5dd6a3d8f210d05e53a7b6fa5e16f1b115f693', '967a21a111757d6af7f7a25ca7ea2bdf6d505098', '4aa8e316bc1c5959537517ed16b4bf81b4bd73ed', '2503dff90685857ce7295e37d0045e2eef41c8b8', '36652428740cd30d245d55889f01a7fb04a91c93', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', 'f09f7888aa5aeaf88a2a44aea768d9a8747e97d2', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '3d846cb01f6a975554035d2210b578ca61344b22', '18b47b83a373f33d6b902a3615f42c10f7600d72', '5d1bfeed240709725c78bc72ea40e55410b373dc', 'f37e1b62a767a307c046404ca96bc140b3e68cb5', 'fff114cbba4f3ba900f33da574283e3de7f26c83']
5822490cf59df7f7ccb92b8901f244850b867a66;ETA Prediction with Graph Neural Networks in Google Maps;Travel-time prediction constitutes a task of high importance in transportation networks, with web mapping services like Google Maps regularly serving vast quantities of travel time queries from users and enterprises alike. Further, such a task requires accounting for complex spatiotemporal interactions (modelling both the topological properties of the road network and anticipating events---such as rush hours---that may occur in the future). Hence, it is an ideal target for graph representation learning at scale. Here we present a graph neural network estimator for estimated time of arrival (ETA) which we have deployed in production at Google Maps. While our main architecture consists of standard GNN building blocks, we further detail the usage of training schedule methods such as MetaGradients in order to make our model robust and production-ready.

One way to handle large datasets is to disperse them across an array of networked computers, each of which implements simple sorting and accumulating, or MapReduce, operations. This cloud computing approach offers many attractive features. If decomposing useful graph operations in terms of MapReduce cycles is possible, it provides incentive for seriously considering cloud computing. Moreover, it offers a way to handle a large graph on a single machine that can't hold the entire graph as well as enables streaming graph processing.

However, an open challenge in this area is developing techniques that can go beyond simple edge prediction and handle more complex logical queries, which might involve multiple unobserved edges, entities, and variables. For instance, given an incomplete biological knowledge graph, we might want to predict ""em what drugs are likely to target proteins involved with both diseases X and Y?"" -- a query that requires reasoning about all possible proteins that might interact with diseases X and Y. Here we introduce a framework to efficiently make predictions about conjunctive logical queries -- a flexible but tractable subset of first-order logic -- on incomplete knowledge graphs. In our approach, we embed graph nodes in a low-dimensional space and represent logical operators as learned geometric operations (e.g., translation, rotation) in this embedding space.";['49437682', '34765717', '2095762', '1746807', '1702139'];['William L.

8731369a707046f3f8dd463d1fd107de31d40a24;Relation Extraction with Multi-instance Multi-label Convolutional Neural Networks;Distant supervision is an efficient approach that automatically generates labeled data for relation extraction (RE). Traditional distantly supervised RE systems rely heavily on handcrafted features, and hence suffer from error propagation. Recently, a neural network architecture has been proposed to automatically extract features for relation classification. However, this approach follows the traditional expressed-at-least-once assumption, and fails to make full use of information across different sentences. Moreover, it ignores the fact that there can be multiple relations holding between the same entity pair. In this paper, we propose a multi-instance multi-label convolutional neural network for distantly supervised RE. It first relaxes the expressed-at-least-once assumption, and employs cross-sentence max-pooling so as to enable information sharing across different sentences. Then it handles overlapping relations by multi-label learning with a neural network classifier. Experimental results show that our approach performs significantly and consistently better than state-of-the-art methods.;['2486289', '143906199', '2197194739', '37722675'];['Xiaotian Jiang', 'Quan Wang', 'Peng Li', 'Bin Wang'];f51ff783-cdff-4e22-94fb-28e6336d17b3;International Conference on Computational Linguistics;conference;1;2016.0;Berlin;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Neural Networks'];['87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f', 'fbe358ce706371b93c10c4395cab9a78ad3aef67']

639206a9a32d91386924f1c94e9760dfb43df72e;Towards Deeper Graph Neural Networks;Graph neural networks have shown significant success in the field of graph representation learning. Graph convolutions perform neighborhood aggregation and represent one of the most important graph operations. Nevertheless, one layer of these neighborhood aggregation methods only consider immediate neighbors, and the performance decreases when going deeper to enable larger receptive fields. Several recent studies attribute this performance deterioration to the over-smoothing issue, which states that repeated propagation makes node representations of different classes indistinguishable. In this work, we study this observation systematically and develop new insights towards deeper graph neural networks. First, we provide a systematical analysis on this issue and argue that the key factor compromising the performance significantly is the entanglement of representation transformation and propagation in current graph convolution operations. After decoupling these two operations, deeper graph neural networks can be used to learn graph node representations from larger receptive fields. We further provide a theoretical;['38813990', '3920758', '1743600'];['Meng Liu', 'Hongyang Gao', 'Shuiwang Ji'];a0edb93b-1e95-4128-a295-6b1659149cef;Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining;conference;8;2020.0;Beijing;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Neural Networks'];['04f3203f1214063436d81ce0c2ad7623204da488', 'ee8b1603c79a4f9c3bdc0d6633b595aa93ff3a0f', '63a513832f56addb67be81a2fa399b233f3030fc', 'ef32feb9acc8e2c4d53c1b9cdd658aa0bca15bd2', '7e71eedb078181873a56f2adcfef9dddaeb95602', 'c2d40522eaa5523d67a0de5e4098e7031fdccb3d', '62ed9bf1d83c8db1f9cbf92ea2f57ea90ef683d9', 'ac225094aab9e7b629bc5b3343e026dea0200c70', 'd18b48f77eb5c517a6d2c1fa434d2952a1b0a825', '5aea95e1ae78a66474051a330ded374e199b658c', 'd81fc968196e06ccafd7ea4c008b13e1cad1be64', 'e4715a13f6364b1c81e64f247651c3d9e80b6808', '36652428740cd30d245d55889f01a7fb04a91c93', '33998aff64ce51df8dee45989cdca4b6b1329ec4', '6b7d6e6416343b2a122f8416e69059ce919026ef', 'e24cdf73b3e7e590c2fe5ecac9ae8aa983801367', 'f09f7888aa5aeaf88a2a44aea768d9a8747e97d2', '36eff562f65125511b5dfab68ce7f7a943c27478', 'c41eb895616e453dcba1a70c9b942c5063cc656c', '29258e7c8a2d43c77933900f4b66e8bdc002943e']
521fc80ac1ee85527386e5354cc0efcf95a70572;Learning to rank networked entities;Several algorithms have been proposed to learn to rank entities modeled as feature vectors, based on relevance feedback. However, these algorithms do not model network connections or relations between entities. Meanwhile, Pagerank and variants find the stationary distribution of a reasonable but arbitrary Markov walk over a network, but do not learn from relevance feedback. We present a framework for ranking networked entities based on Markov walks with parameterized conductance values associated with the network edges. We propose two flavors of conductance learning problems in our framework. In the first setting, relevance feedback comparing node-pairs hints that the user has one or more hidden preferred communities with large edge conductance, and the algorithm must discover these communities. We present a constrained maximum entropy network flow formulation whose dual can be solved efficiently using a cutting-plane approach and a quasi-Newton optimizer. In the second setting, edges have types, and relevance feedback;['40333747', '40941894', '2232559'];['Alekh Agarwal', 'Soumen Chakrabarti', 'Sunny Aggarwal'];a0edb93b-1e95-4128-a295-6b1659149cef;Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining;conference;5;2006.0;Chicago;;;;;['Computer Science', 'Mathematics'];[]

In this work, we propose a novel model of dynamic skeletons called Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN), which moves beyond the limitations of previous methods by automatically learning both the spatial and temporal patterns from data. This formulation not only leads to greater expressive power but also stronger generalization capability.

454304628bf10f02aba1c2cfc95891e94d09208e;Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Structural and Positional Representations;Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the standard learning architectures for graphs. GNNs have been applied to numerous domains ranging from quantum chemistry, recommender systems to knowledge graphs and natural language processing. A major issue with arbitrary graphs is the absence of canonical positional information of nodes, which decreases the representation power of GNNs to distinguish e.g. isomorphic nodes and other graph symmetries. An approach to tackle this issue is to introduce Positional Encoding (PE) of nodes, and inject it into the input layer, like in Transformers. Possible graph PE are Laplacian eigenvectors. In this work, we propose to decouple structural and positional representations to make easy for the network to learn these two essential properties. We introduce a novel generic architecture which we call LSPE (Learnable Structural and Positional Encodings). We investigate several sparse and fully-connected (Transformer-like) GNNs, and observe a performance increase for molecular datasets, from 1.79% up;['51235219', '1755919', '81634721', '1751762', '2549032'];['Vijay Prakash Dwivedi', 'A.

In this paper we introduce an expressive neural tensor network suitable for reasoning over relationships between two entities. Previous work represented entities as either discrete atomic units or with a single entity vector representation. We show that performance can be improved when entities are represented as an average of their constituting word vectors. This allows sharing of statistical strength between, for instance, facts involving the ""Sumatran tiger"" and ""Bengal tiger."" Lastly, we demonstrate that all models improve when these word vectors are initialized with vectors learned from unsupervised large corpora. We assess the model by considering the problem of predicting additional true relations between entities given a subset of the knowledge base.

The architecture is a form of Memory Network [23] but unlike the model in that work, it is trained end-to-end, and hence requires significantly less supervision during training, making it more generally applicable in realistic settings. It can also be seen as an extension of RNNsearch [2] to the case where multiple computational steps (hops) are performed per output symbol. The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering [22] and to language modeling. For the former our approach is competitive with Memory Networks, but with less supervision. For the latter, on the Penn TreeBank and Text8 datasets our approach demonstrates comparable performance to RNNs and LSTMs. In both cases we show that the key concept of multiple computational hops yields improved results.;['2265067', '3149531', '145183709', '2276554'];['Sainbayar Sukhbaatar', 'Arthur Szlam', 'J.

Results: Here, we present OhmNet, a hierarchy‐aware unsupervised node feature learning approach for multi‐layer networks. We build a multi‐layer network, where each layer represents molecular interactions in a different human tissue. OhmNet then automatically learns a mapping of proteins, represented as nodes, to a neural embedding‐based low‐dimensional space of features. OhmNet encourages sharing of similar features among proteins with similar network neighborhoods and among proteins activated in similar tissues. The algorithm generalizes prior work, which generally ignores relationships between tissues, by modeling tissue organization with a rich multiscale tissue hierarchy. We use OhmNet to study multicellular function in a multi‐layer protein interaction network of 107 human tissues. In 48 tissues with known tissue‐specific cellular functions, OhmNet provides more accurate predictions;['2095762', '1702139'];['M. Zitnik', 'J.

It builds a user's profile as her historically interacted items, recommending new items that are similar to the user's profile. As such, the key to an item-based CF method is in the estimation of item similarities. Early approaches use statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Pearson coefficient to estimate item similarities, which are less accurate since they lack tailored optimization for the recommendation task. In recent years, several works attempt to learn item similarities from data, by expressing the similarity as an underlying model and estimating model parameters by optimizing a recommendation-aware objective function. While extensive efforts have been made to use shallow linear models for learning item similarities, there has been relatively less work exploring nonlinear neural network models for item-based CF.

7d4dcee4628745f79f5e352859172817fece3e83;Adaptive Graph Encoder for Attributed Graph Embedding;Attributed graph embedding, which learns vector representations from graph topology and node features, is a challenging task for graph analysis. Recently, methods based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have made great progress on this task. However,existing GCN-based methods have three major drawbacks. Firstly,our experiments indicate that the entanglement of graph convolutional filters and weight matrices will harm both the performance and robustness. Secondly, we show that graph convolutional filters in these methods reveal to be special cases of generalized Laplacian smoothing filters, but they do not preserve optimal low-pass characteristics. Finally, the training objectives of existing algorithms are usually recovering the adjacency matrix or feature matrix, which are not always consistent with real-world applications. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Graph Encoder (AGE), a novel attributed graph embedding framework.

Recent work showed that such generative models can be utilized in statistical mechanics to sample equilibrium states of many-body systems in physics and chemistry. To scale and generalize these results, it is essential that the natural symmetries in the probability density - in physics defined by the invariances of the target potential - are built into the flow. We provide a theoretical sufficient criterion showing that the distribution generated by equivariant normalizing flows is invariant with respect to these symmetries by design. Furthermore, we propose building blocks for flows which preserve symmetries which are usually found in physical/chemical many-body particle systems. Using benchmark systems motivated from molecular physics, we demonstrate that those symmetry preserving flows can provide better generalization capabilities and sampling efficiency.;['32602330', '1380082499', '1967674'];['Jonas Köhler', 'Leon Klein', 'F.

2335a95bfed617953675b5227cc881707746f53b;Unifying Knowledge Graph Learning and Recommendation: Towards a Better Understanding of User Preferences;Incorporating knowledge graph (KG) into recommender system is promising in improving the recommendation accuracy and explainability. However, existing methods largely assume that a KG is complete and simply transfer the ”knowledge” in KG at the shallow level of entity raw data or embeddings. This may lead to suboptimal performance, since a practical KG can hardly be complete, and it is common that a KG has missing facts, relations, and entities. Thus, we argue that it is crucial to consider the incomplete nature of KG when incorporating it into recommender system. In this paper, we jointly learn the model of recommendation and knowledge graph completion. Distinct from previous KG-based recommendation methods, we transfer the relation information in KG, so as to understand the reasons that a user likes an item. As an example, if a user has watched several movies directed by (relation) the same person (entity), we can infer that;['145014675', '2144796537', '7792071', '51193721', '144078686'];['Yixin Cao', 'Xiang Wang', 'Xiangnan He', 'Zikun Hu', 'Tat-Seng Chua'];e07422f9-c065-40c3-a37b-75e98dce79fe;The Web Conference;conference;2;2019.0;Houston;;;;;['Graph', 'Computer Science'];['5aadc803228b70c3cc6b31e332770d47d7fb1e6e', '74c2878df89fcc2be28eae8523757d6d491457ea', 'd0f1809dc696134fb8fb2a3ff5a982eeacdc7127', 'e9287b896a1c7360567915c3932b8df1ee4a81f7', '2218e2e1df2c3adfb70e0def2e326a39928aacfc', '955fe2ee26d888ae22749b0853981b8b581b133d', '994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726', '2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05', '2582ab7c70c9e7fcb84545944eba8f3a7f253248', 'eb6208f3e2c0942e38ceffc443dcf64d2cb4ec82']

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.;['1726807', '1678311'];['Diederik P. Kingma', 'M.

f1ed01a2c0aa47b4e010861ef884980561ddb542;Self-supervised Learning of Dense Shape Correspondence;We introduce the first completely unsupervised correspondence learning approach for deformable 3D shapes. Key to our model is the understanding that natural deformations (such as changes in pose) approximately preserve the metric structure of the surface, yielding a natural criterion to drive the learning process toward distortion-minimizing predictions. On this basis, we overcome the need for annotated data and replace it by a purely geometric criterion. The resulting learning model is class-agnostic, and is able to leverage any type of deformable geometric data for the training phase. In contrast to existing supervised approaches which specialize on the class seen at training time, we demonstrate stronger generalization as well as applicability to a variety of challenging settings. We showcase our method on a wide selection of correspondence benchmarks, where we outperform other methods in terms of accuracy, generalization, and efficiency.;['2066145023', '2528439', '1796150', '49791556', '143923265'];['Oshri Halimi', 'O.

The framework consists of two operators: extension and restriction, mapping point cloud functions to volumetric functions and vise-versa. A point cloud convolution is defined by pull-back of the Euclidean volumetric convolution via an extension-restriction mechanism. The point cloud convolution is computationally efficient, invariant to the order of points in the point cloud, robust to different samplings and varying densities, and translation invariant, that is the same convolution kernel is used at all points. PCNN generalizes image CNNs and allows readily adapting their architectures to the point cloud setting. Evaluation of PCNN on three central point cloud learning benchmarks convincingly outperform competing point cloud learning methods, and the vast majority of methods working with more informative shape representations such as surfaces and/or normals.;['40902317', '3416939', '3232072'];['Matan Atzmon', 'Haggai Maron', 'Y.

However, building systems that provide such recommendations presents a major challenge due to a massive pool of items, a large number of users, and requirements for recommendations to be responsive to user actions and generated on demand in real-time. Here we present Pixie, a scalable graph-based real-time recommender system that we developed and deployed at Pinterest. Given a set of user-specific pins as a query, Pixie selects in real-time from billions of possible pins those that are most related to the query. To generate recommendations, we develop Pixie Random Walk algorithm that utilizes the Pinterest object graph of 3 billion nodes and 17 billion edges. Experiments show that recommendations provided by Pixie lead up to 50% higher user engagement when compared to the previous Hadoop-based production system. Furthermore, we develop a graph pruning strategy at that leads;['2311320', '50435146', '3195628', None, '2111334186', '2070754135', '145684887', '1702139'];['Chantat Eksombatchai', 'Pranav Jindal', 'Zitao Liu', 'Yuchen Liu', 'Rahul Sharma', 'Charles Sugnet', 'Mark Ulrich', 'J.
